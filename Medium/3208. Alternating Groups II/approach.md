To solve this problem, we need to efficiently count all contiguous subarrays of length `k` in the circular array that have alternating colors. Let's break the approach down:

### **1. Handling the Circular Nature**
Since the array represents a circle, we need to handle the wrap-around case properly. One effective way is to extend the array by appending the first `k-1` elements to the end. This allows us to iterate normally and check subarrays without special handling for the circular connection.

### **2. Sliding Window for Checking Alternating Groups**
- We slide a window of length `k` across the array.
- At each step, check if the `k` elements in the window follow an alternating pattern.
- A valid alternating sequence means:
  - Every tile at index `i` (except the first and last) has a different color from both its neighbors.
  - This condition can be checked in `O(k)` time per window.

### **3. Efficiently Iterating Over Windows**
- Instead of checking all possible windows from scratch (`O(nk)` complexity), we iterate once over the extended array (`O(n) complexity`).
- A valid alternating sequence follows a pattern where `colors[i]` must differ from `colors[i-1]`. We can check this in a single pass.

### **4. Counting Valid Groups**
- Keep a count of valid alternating windows.
- Return the total count at the end.

This approach ensures we efficiently count the number of valid alternating groups in `O(n)`, making it optimal for large inputs.
