The concept of **counting alternating groups in a circular array** has real-world applications in various fields. Here are two practical examples:

### **1. Traffic Light Cycle Analysis (Smart Traffic Systems ðŸš¦)**  
- **Scenario:** In a city with smart traffic lights, sensors record alternating red and green light sequences at different intersections.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - Given a circular sequence of traffic light states (`0` for red, `1` for green), authorities need to detect alternating patterns over `k` consecutive time intervals.  
  - This helps analyze whether signals are following a proper alternating cycle or if some areas have irregular light patterns that cause congestion.  

- **Example:**
  - Data from a roundabout is recorded: `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`  
  - If `k = 3`, we count how many segments follow an alternating pattern.
  - This can help optimize traffic light timing to improve vehicle flow.

### **2. Wireless Network Signal Switching (5G Networks ðŸ“¡)**  
- **Scenario:** Wireless networks frequently switch between two frequency bands (`0` for low-frequency, `1` for high-frequency) to optimize coverage and speed.  
- **Use Case:**  
  - A network provider analyzes the frequency hopping pattern in a circular manner to ensure efficient load balancing.  
  - If `k` consecutive frequency switches don't alternate properly, it might indicate interference or inefficient bandwidth allocation.  

- **Example:**
  - A 5G base station logs frequency changes over time: `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]`  
  - The provider wants to check if `k = 4` frequency transitions follow an alternating pattern.
  - If the count is too low, they might adjust frequency hopping to minimize congestion and maximize performance.

These real-world cases show how detecting alternating patterns in circular sequences can be useful in **traffic control, network optimization, and more!** ðŸš€
