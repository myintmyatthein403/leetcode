To solve the problem of counting servers that can communicate with each other, we can follow this approach in JavaScript:

1. Traverse the grid to count the number of servers in each row and each column.
2. Traverse the grid again to count the servers that can communicate with at least one other server.

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
function countServers(grid) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    const rowCount = new Array(rows).fill(0);
    const colCount = new Array(cols).fill(0);

    // First pass: count servers in each row and column
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                rowCount[i]++;
                colCount[j]++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Second pass: count servers that can communicate
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1 && (rowCount[i] > 1 || colCount[j] > 1)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
const grid1 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]];
console.log(countServers(grid1)); // Output: 0

const grid2 = [[1, 0], [1, 1]];
console.log(countServers(grid2)); // Output: 3

const grid3 = [[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]];
console.log(countServers(grid3)); // Output: 4
```

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the servers that can communicate by leveraging two passes through the grid. The first pass counts the servers in each row and column, and the second pass checks if each server can communicate with others based on the counts.
