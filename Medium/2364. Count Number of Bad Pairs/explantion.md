# Explanation of Time Limit Exceeded Error

Let's compare the two solutions in terms of their approach and efficiency.

### Initial Solution (Brute Force)

```javascript
var countBadPairs = function(nums) {
    let result = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        for (var j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if ((j - i) !== (nums[j] - nums[i])) {
                result++;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
};
```

#### Approach:
- This solution uses a nested loop to compare every possible pair `(i, j)` in the array.
- For each pair, it checks if `(j - i) !== (nums[j] - nums[i])`.
- If the condition is true, it increments the `result` counter.

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is `O(n^2)` because it involves two nested loops, each iterating over the array.
- This can lead to a time limit exceeded error for large input sizes.

### Optimized Solution (Using HashMap)

```javascript
var countBadPairs = function(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    let map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let diff = nums[i] - i;
        if (map.has(diff)) {
            count += map.get(diff);
            map.set(diff, map.get(diff) + 1);
        } else {
            map.set(diff, 1);
        }
    }
    return (nums.length * (nums.length - 1)) / 2 - count;
};
```

#### Approach:
- This solution uses a hashmap to store the frequency of `(nums[i] - i)` values.
- For each element `nums[i]`, it calculates `diff = nums[i] - i`.
- If `diff` is already in the map, it means there are `map.get(diff)` elements before `i` that form good pairs with `nums[i]`. This count is added to `count`.
- The map is then updated with the new frequency of `diff`.
- Finally, the total number of pairs is calculated using the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2`, and the number of good pairs (`count`) is subtracted from it to get the number of bad pairs.

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is `O(n)` because it involves a single loop that iterates over the array and performs constant-time operations with the hashmap.
- This makes the solution much more efficient and suitable for large input sizes.

### Comparison:

| Aspect               | Initial Solution (Brute Force) | Optimized Solution (Using HashMap) |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Approach             | Nested loops to compare pairs  | Single loop with hashmap           |
| Time Complexity      | `O(n^2)`                       | `O(n)`                             |
| Space Complexity     | `O(1)`                         | `O(n)` (due to hashmap)            |
| Efficiency           | Inefficient for large inputs   | Efficient for large inputs         |

The optimized solution significantly reduces the time complexity by using a hashmap to store and retrieve the frequency of `(nums[i] - i)` values, making it suitable for large input sizes.
