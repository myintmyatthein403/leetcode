This problem can be solved efficiently using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, as it follows the **Optimal Substructure** and **Overlapping Subproblems** properties.

---

### **Approach**
We define a **DP state** where:
- `dp[i]` represents the **maximum points** that can be earned starting from question `i` to the end.

The **transition** involves two choices for each question `i`:
1. **Solve the current question (`i`)**  
   - Earn `points[i]`
   - Skip the next `brainpower[i]` questions
   - Move to question `i + brainpower[i] + 1`
   - The total score will be:  
     \[
     dp[i] = \text{points}[i] + dp[i + \text{brainpower}[i] + 1]
     \]

2. **Skip the current question (`i`)**  
   - Move to the next question (`i + 1`)
   - The total score remains the same as `dp[i + 1]`:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i + 1]
     \]

The optimal value for `dp[i]` will be the **maximum** of these two choices:
\[
dp[i] = \max(\text{points}[i] + dp[i + \text{brainpower}[i] + 1], dp[i + 1])
\]

---

### **Implementation Strategy**
- Use **bottom-up DP with memoization**.
- Iterate **backward** from the last question to the first.
- Use an array `dp` to store maximum points at each index.
- The base case: `dp[n] = 0` (beyond the last question, no points can be earned).

---

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) â†’ We process each question once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) â†’ We store `dp` values for each question.

This approach ensures we efficiently determine the maximum points possible while following the constraints of the problem. ðŸš€
