To solve the problem of calculating the product of the last `k` numbers efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a class `ProductOfNumbers` with a constructor that initializes an empty array `nums` to store the cumulative products of the numbers added.

2. **Add Method**:
   - When a number `num` is added:
     - If `num` is `0`, reset the `nums` array to an empty array because any product involving zero will be zero.
     - If `num` is not `0`, calculate the cumulative product by multiplying the last element in the `nums` array with `num` and push the result to the `nums` array. If the `nums` array is empty, simply push `num`.

3. **GetProduct Method**:
   - To get the product of the last `k` numbers:
     - If `k` is greater than the length of the `nums` array, return `0` because it means there are not enough numbers to calculate the product.
     - If `k` is equal to the length of the `nums` array, return the last element in the `nums` array because it represents the product of all numbers added so far.
     - Otherwise, return the result of dividing the last element in the `nums` array by the element at the position `length - k - 1` in the `nums` array. This gives the product of the last `k` numbers by effectively canceling out the product of the preceding numbers.

This approach ensures that both the `add` and `getProduct` operations are efficient, with the `add` operation being O(1) and the `getProduct` operation being O(1) as well.
