Here are two real-world examples where the `ProductOfNumbers` class could be useful:

1. **Stock Price Analysis**:
   - In financial markets, analysts often need to calculate the product of stock price changes over a specific period to understand the overall growth or decline. For example, if you have daily percentage changes in stock prices, you can use the `ProductOfNumbers` class to add these daily changes and quickly calculate the product of the last `k` days to determine the compounded growth rate over that period.

2. **Sensor Data Processing**:
   - In IoT (Internet of Things) applications, sensors might collect data at regular intervals, such as temperature, humidity, or pressure readings. If you need to calculate the product of the last `k` readings to detect anomalies or trends, the `ProductOfNumbers` class can help. For instance, in a manufacturing process, the product of the last `k` pressure readings might be used to ensure that machinery is operating within safe limits.
