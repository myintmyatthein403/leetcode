### Real World Examples of Usage

1. **Network Security**:
   In a computer network, nodes (computers or devices) can be represented as a directed graph where edges represent communication paths. Identifying eventual safe states can help in determining which nodes are secure and not part of any potential attack paths or loops. For instance, in a network where certain nodes are known to be compromised, finding eventual safe states can help in isolating and securing the rest of the network.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   In software development, projects often have dependencies on various libraries or modules. These dependencies can be represented as a directed graph where nodes are modules and edges represent dependency relationships. Identifying eventual safe states can help in determining which modules are stable and do not depend on any unstable or cyclic dependencies. This can be crucial for ensuring that the software build process is reliable and free from dependency issues.

These examples illustrate how finding eventual safe states in a directed graph can be applied to practical problems in network security and software dependency management.
