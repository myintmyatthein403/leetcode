To solve the problem of determining if a parentheses string can be made valid given the constraints, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Check**: If the length of the string `s` is odd, return `false` immediately because a valid parentheses string must have an even length.

2. **Balance Check**: Traverse the string from left to right and right to left to ensure that the number of open and close parentheses can be balanced.

3. **Left to Right Traversal**:
   - Initialize a counter `balance` to 0.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is `'('` or it is `'0'` (indicating it can be changed), increment the `balance`.
     - If the character is `')'`, decrement the `balance`.
     - If at any point `balance` becomes negative, return `false` because there are more closing parentheses than opening ones.

4. **Right to Left Traversal**:
   - Initialize a counter `balance` to 0.
   - For each character in the string from right to left:
     - If the character is `')'` or it is `'0'` (indicating it can be changed), increment the `balance`.
     - If the character is `'('`, decrement the `balance`.
     - If at any point `balance` becomes negative, return `false` because there are more opening parentheses than closing ones.

5. **Final Check**: If both traversals pass without returning `false`, return `true`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
def canBeValid(s: str, locked: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) % 2 != 0:
        return False
    
    balance = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(' or locked[i] == '0':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    
    balance = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ')' or locked[i] == '0':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    
    return True
```

This code ensures that the parentheses string can be made valid by checking both directions and considering the locked positions.
