Here are two real-world examples where checking if a parentheses string can be valid is useful:

1. **Code Syntax Validation**:
   - **Scenario**: In a code editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Neovim, when a developer writes code, the editor needs to ensure that all parentheses are properly closed and nested to avoid syntax errors.
   - **Usage**: The IDE can use a similar algorithm to check if the parentheses in the code are balanced and valid. If the parentheses are not valid, the IDE can highlight the error and suggest corrections.

2. **Expression Evaluation in Calculators**:
   - **Scenario**: In a scientific calculator or a mathematical expression evaluator, users often input complex expressions with multiple levels of nested parentheses.
   - **Usage**: Before evaluating the expression, the calculator can use this algorithm to check if the parentheses are balanced and valid. If the expression has invalid parentheses, the calculator can prompt the user to correct the input before proceeding with the evaluation.
