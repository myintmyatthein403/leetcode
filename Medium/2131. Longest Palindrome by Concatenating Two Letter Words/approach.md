To solve this problem **efficiently**, we need to understand how two-letter words can contribute to a **palindromic string**.

---

### üîç Key Observations:

1. **Palindrome Requirement**: A palindrome reads the same forward and backward. So, for any word we add to the left, we need a matching word to add to the right in reverse.

2. **Word Types**:

   * **Symmetric words**: Words where both letters are the same (e.g., `"gg"`, `"cc"`). These are palindromic on their own.
   * **Asymmetric words**: Words like `"ab"`, `"ba"`‚Äîreverse of each other.

---

### ‚úÖ Strategy:

1. **Count each word**: Use a dictionary or `Counter` to store the frequency of each word.

2. **Pair up asymmetric words**:

   * For each word (e.g., `"ab"`), check if its reverse (`"ba"`) exists.
   * Pair as many as possible between `"ab"` and `"ba"`‚Äîeach such pair contributes **4** characters to the palindrome (`"ab" + ... + ba"`).

3. **Handle symmetric words (like `"gg"`)**:

   * Use them in pairs (e.g., two `"gg"`s can be `"gg" + ... + gg"`). Each such pair adds **4** characters.
   * If there's an **odd count**, one single symmetric word can be placed **in the middle** of the palindrome, contributing **2** characters. Only **one** such central word is allowed.

4. **Total length**:

   * Each matched asymmetric or symmetric pair adds 4.
   * Optionally add 2 if there's an unused symmetric word for the center.

---

### üß† Intuition Recap:

* Pair asymmetric words with their reverse (e.g., `"ab"` with `"ba"`).
* Pair symmetric words with themselves (e.g., two `"cc"`s).
* Place one leftover symmetric word in the middle, if available.

This approach ensures **maximum reuse** of available words while respecting palindrome symmetry.
