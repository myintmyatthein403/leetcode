Here are two real-world examples where the function `doesValidArrayExist` can be used:

### Example 1: Network Packet Validation
In a network communication system, packets of data are often validated using checksums or parity bits to ensure data integrity. The `derived` array can represent the parity bits of a sequence of packets. The function `doesValidArrayExist` can be used to check if the sequence of packets is valid based on the parity bits.

```javascript
const derived = [1, 0, 1, 1]; // Parity bits for a sequence of packets
const isValid = doesValidArrayExist(derived);
console.log(`Is the sequence of packets valid? ${isValid ? 'Yes' : 'No'}`); // Output: No
```

### Example 2: Error Detection in Data Storage
In data storage systems, error detection codes are used to detect and correct errors in stored data. The `derived` array can represent the error detection codes for a sequence of data blocks. The function `doesValidArrayExist` can be used to check if the sequence of data blocks is error-free based on the error detection codes.

```javascript
const derived = [0, 1, 0, 0]; // Error detection codes for a sequence of data blocks
const isValid = doesValidArrayExist(derived);
console.log(`Is the sequence of data blocks error-free? ${isValid ? 'Yes' : 'No'}`); // Output: Yes
```

In both examples, the function `doesValidArrayExist` helps in validating the integrity of sequences based on the derived XOR values, ensuring that the data is consistent and error-free.
