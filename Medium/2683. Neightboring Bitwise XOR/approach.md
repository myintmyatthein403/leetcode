To solve this problem, you need to determine if there exists a valid binary array `original` that can produce the given `derived` array using the specified bitwise XOR operations. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the XOR Operation**:
   - XOR (⊕) between two bits results in `1` if the bits are different, and `0` if they are the same.

2. **Formulate the Problem**:
   - For each index `i` in the `derived` array:
     - If `i = n - 1`, then `derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[i + 1]`.

3. **Check for Validity**:
   - You need to check if there exists a binary array `original` such that the above conditions hold true for all elements in `derived`.

4. **Iterate and Verify**:
   - Start with an assumption for `original[0]` (either `0` or `1`).
   - Use the given `derived` array to compute the rest of the `original` array.
   - Verify if the computed `original` array satisfies the conditions for the entire `derived` array.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where the length of `derived` is very small (e.g., `n = 1` or `n = 2`).

Here is a Python function implementing the above approach:

```python
def does_valid_original_exist(derived):
    n = len(derived)
    
    def is_valid(original):
        for i in range(n):
            if i == n - 1:
                if derived[i] != (original[i] ^ original[0]):
                    return False
            else:
                if derived[i] != (original[i] ^ original[i + 1]):
                    return False
        return True
    
    # Try with original[0] = 0
    original = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        original[i] = derived[i - 1] ^ original[i - 1]
    if is_valid(original):
        return True
    
    # Try with original[0] = 1
    original = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        original[i] = derived[i - 1] ^ original[i - 1]
    if is_valid(original):
        return True
    
    return False

# Example usage:
derived = [1, 1, 0]
print(does_valid_original_exist(derived))  # Output: True
```

This function checks both possible starting values for `original[0]` (0 and 1) and verifies if a valid `original` array can be constructed for the given `derived` array.
