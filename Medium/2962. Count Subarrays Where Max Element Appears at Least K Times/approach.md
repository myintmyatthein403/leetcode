To solve this problem efficiently, we need to **count all subarrays where the maximum element appears at least `k` times**. Let's break down the **approach conceptually**:

### Step-by-Step Strategy:

1. **Understand the role of the maximum element**:
   - In any valid subarray, the maximum element **within that subarray** must appear **at least `k` times**.
   - That means we cannot fix one global maximum; we must consider **subarrays independently**, but still aim for efficiency.

2. **Sliding window approach (with variations)**:
   - To avoid brute-force O(n³), we want to use a **windowed** approach to efficiently count subarrays satisfying the condition.

3. **Observation**:
   - Suppose we fix all occurrences of the **maximum element** (say `max_val`) in `nums`.
   - Now, consider **each contiguous segment of `nums` that contains this `max_val` as its maximum**.
   - Within such a segment, we can now look for **subarrays with at least `k` occurrences of `max_val`**.

4. **Efficient plan**:
   - Step 1: Identify the **global maximum** value in `nums` (let's call it `max_val`).
   - Step 2: Traverse the array and find **windows (segments)** where `max_val` appears.
   - Step 3: For each such segment, use a **sliding window** or two-pointer technique to count subarrays where `max_val` appears at least `k` times.
     - Start with two pointers `start` and `end`.
     - Move `end` to expand the window, and count the number of times `max_val` occurs.
     - When the count of `max_val` in the window is at least `k`, all subarrays starting from `start` to `end` are valid.
     - Move `start` forward while maintaining the condition, and count the valid subarrays.

5. **Skip segments**:
   - Any part of the array that doesn't contain `max_val` as the maximum is **ignored**—those can't form valid subarrays for this specific condition.

### Key Efficiency Ideas:
- Rather than generating all possible subarrays (O(n²)), we use a **two-pointer method** to count only the valid ones in linear or near-linear time.
- We focus only on regions that have a **chance to meet the criteria**, cutting down unnecessary computation.
