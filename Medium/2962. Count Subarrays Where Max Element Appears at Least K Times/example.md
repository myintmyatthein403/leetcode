Here are **two real-world examples** and **one web development example** where this kind of algorithm (counting subarrays with a condition involving the max element) can be applied:

---

### üîπ **Real-World Example 1: Stock Price Analysis**
**Scenario**: A financial analyst wants to identify time intervals (subarrays) in stock price data where the highest stock price during the interval occurs **at least `k` times**.  
**Use Case**: This can indicate strong resistance or support levels where the price repeatedly reaches a peak, possibly useful for trading strategies.

- **Input**: A time-series array of daily stock prices.
- **Goal**: Count how many continuous periods have the peak price repeated at least `k` times.
- **Why**: Repeated max prices within an interval may signal consolidation before a breakout.

### üîπ **Real-World Example 2: Quality Control in Manufacturing**
**Scenario**: In a factory, sensor readings (like temperature or pressure) are recorded over time. Engineers want to find periods where the sensor hits its **maximum threshold at least `k` times** within a short span.

- **Input**: Array of sensor readings.
- **Goal**: Identify subarrays where the maximum value (possibly indicating a warning or critical level) occurs repeatedly.
- **Why**: Repeated critical readings can trigger automatic quality checks or maintenance alerts.

### üåê **Web Development Example: User Activity Monitoring**
**Scenario**: In a web app (e.g., analytics dashboard), admins want to detect **bursts of user activity**, where the highest number of interactions (e.g., clicks, pageviews) happens at least `k` times within short intervals.

- **Input**: Array where each element is the number of interactions per minute.
- **Goal**: Find how many time windows (subarrays) have the **peak interaction count** repeated at least `k` times.
- **Why**: To detect spammy behavior or high-engagement trends, for alerting or analytics.
