To solve the problem of counting **complete subarrays**, we need a smart and efficient way to find all subarrays that contain **all distinct elements** of the original array. Here's the high-level **approach and explanation**:

---

### âœ… **1. Understand What a Complete Subarray Is**
A subarray is **complete** if:
- It is contiguous.
- It contains all the **distinct elements** that are present in the entire `nums` array.

---

### âœ… **2. Count Total Distinct Elements**
First, calculate the number of **distinct elements** in the entire array. Letâ€™s call this `totalDistinct`.

This is important because weâ€™ll use this value to check whether a subarray is complete.

---

### âœ… **3. Use a Sliding Window Approach**
We can use a **sliding window** (or two-pointer technique) to find the number of subarrays that contain **fewer than** `totalDistinct` elements.

Why?
- If we can count all the subarrays that **do not** satisfy the complete condition, we can subtract that from the **total number of subarrays** to get the number of complete ones.

---

### âœ… **4. Count Total Number of Subarrays**
For an array of length `n`, the total number of subarrays is:
```
n * (n + 1) / 2
```

---

### âœ… **5. Subtract Incomplete Subarrays**
Use the sliding window to count subarrays with **fewer** than `totalDistinct` unique elements. We do this by:
- Maintaining a frequency map or counter for current window elements.
- Expanding the window until it has `totalDistinct - 1` or fewer distinct elements.
- For each valid window, count how many subarrays start at the current left pointer and end anywhere before the window becomes complete.

---

### âœ… **6. Final Answer**
```
Answer = Total number of subarrays - Number of subarrays with fewer than totalDistinct elements
```

---

### ðŸ§  Why This Works
This method is efficient because:
- It avoids brute-forcing all subarrays (which is O(nÂ²)).
- It uses a sliding window with linear complexity, resulting in **O(n)** or **O(n log n)** time depending on the data structures used.
