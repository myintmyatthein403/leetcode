To solve the **Set Matrix Zeroes** problem **in-place**, we need an approach that avoids using extra space beyond a constant amount (i.e., **O(1)** space complexity, besides the matrix itself). Here‚Äôs the strategy and step-by-step explanation:

### üîç **Key Insight:**

When we encounter a `0` in the matrix, we need to mark its **entire row and column** to become `0`. But if we start modifying the matrix immediately, we may lose the original information and unintentionally affect other elements.

To avoid this while still using **O(1) space**, we can use the **first row and first column** of the matrix as markers to keep track of which rows and columns should be zeroed.

### ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Approach:**

1. **Detect if the first row or first column originally contains any zeros.**

   * We‚Äôll use separate flags (`firstRowHasZero`, `firstColHasZero`) because we‚Äôll use the first row and column for marking other rows and columns.

2. **Use the rest of the matrix to mark rows and columns that should be zeroed.**

   * For every element `matrix[i][j] == 0`, mark:

     * `matrix[i][0] = 0` (mark the row)
     * `matrix[0][j] = 0` (mark the column)

3. **Zero out cells based on the markers in the first row and column.**

   * Iterate through the matrix **excluding the first row and column**, and for each cell:

     * If `matrix[i][0] == 0` **or** `matrix[0][j] == 0`, then set `matrix[i][j] = 0`.

4. **Zero out the first row and/or first column if needed.**

   * If `firstRowHasZero` is true, set all cells in the first row to 0.
   * If `firstColHasZero` is true, set all cells in the first column to 0.

### üìå Why This Works:

* **Space Efficiency:** You use the matrix itself to store markers, achieving constant extra space.
* **In-Place Requirement:** All changes are made directly in the input matrix.
* **Separation of Concerns:** By handling the first row and column separately at the end, you avoid interfering with your marker logic.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases:

* Matrix with just one row or column.
* Matrix where the only zero is in the first row or column.
* Matrix where all elements are already zero.
