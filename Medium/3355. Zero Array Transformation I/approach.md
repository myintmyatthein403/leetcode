To determine whether we can transform the array `nums` into a **Zero Array** using a sequence of queries where **each query allows us to decrement any subset of elements in a given range**, we need to understand a few key properties:

---

### ‚úÖ Key Observations:

1. **Each query lets us choose any subset** in the given range `[li, ri]`, meaning we can selectively decrease any values in that subrange by 1.

   * We're not required to decrement **all** elements in the range.
   * We're not allowed to **increment** values or affect elements **outside** the range.

2. **Each query is performed once and in sequence.**

   * Once a query is completed, its effect on `nums` is permanent before the next query is applied.

3. **The final array must be entirely zeros.**

---

### üß† Strategy:

To decide whether transformation to a Zero Array is possible, we need to consider the **total "available decrements" per index** provided by the sequence of queries.

Let‚Äôs define:

* `count[i]`: number of times index `i` is covered by the queries.

This means:

* Index `i` can be decremented at most `count[i]` times across all queries.

So, the value at `nums[i]` must be **less than or equal to** `count[i]` ‚Äî otherwise, there are not enough opportunities to decrement `nums[i]` down to 0.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Check:

* For each index `i` in `nums`, check if:

  ```
  nums[i] <= count[i]
  ```

* If this holds true for **all** indices, then it's **possible** to selectively apply decrements during the queries to make every value zero.

* If **any** index has a value greater than the number of times it's included in the queries, return `false`.

---

### üß™ Example Walkthrough

**Example 1:**

```
nums = [1, 0, 1]
queries = [[0, 2]]
```

* `count = [1, 1, 1]`
* Check: `nums[i] <= count[i]` ‚Üí All good.
* So, return `true`.

**Example 2:**

```
nums = [4, 3, 2, 1]
queries = [[1, 3], [0, 2]]
```

* After both queries:

  * Index 0 is covered once ‚Üí count\[0] = 1
  * Index 1 is covered twice ‚Üí count\[1] = 2
  * Index 2 is covered twice ‚Üí count\[2] = 2
  * Index 3 is covered once ‚Üí count\[3] = 1

Now check:

* nums\[0] = 4 > 1 ‚ùå ‚Üí Not enough queries to decrement this to 0.

Return `false`.

---

### üß© Summary

1. Compute how many times each index is covered by the queries.
2. Check that `nums[i] <= count[i]` for every index.
3. If so, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

This approach ensures we respect the limits of each query and check feasibility efficiently.
