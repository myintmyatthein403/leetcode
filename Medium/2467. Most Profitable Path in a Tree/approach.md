### **Understanding the Problem**
We have an **undirected tree** where each node represents a gate with a cost or reward. Alice and Bob move in **opposite directions**:
- **Alice** starts at node `0` and moves toward an **optimal leaf node** (a node with no children).
- **Bob** starts at node `bob` and moves toward node `0`.

At every node:
- If **only Alice** reaches the node, she receives the **full amount** (reward or cost).
- If **only Bob** reaches the node first, he takes the **full cost/reward**, and Alice **gets nothing** when she arrives.
- If **Alice and Bob reach a node simultaneously**, they **split the amount** equally.

We need to **maximize Aliceâ€™s net income** by choosing an optimal path to a **leaf node**.

### **Key Observations**
1. **Graph Representation**:  
   - The input is given as an `edges` list, which we can use to build an **adjacency list** representation of the tree.
   
2. **Bobâ€™s Path Calculation**:  
   - Since Bob always moves toward `0`, his path from `bob â†’ 0` can be precomputed.
   - We use this path to determine if Bob **reaches a node before, after, or simultaneously** with Alice.

3. **Aliceâ€™s Optimal Path to a Leaf**:  
   - Alice should choose a path that **maximizes her total income**.
   - A **Depth-First Search (DFS)** can be used to explore all possible paths Alice can take.

### **Approach to Solve**
1. **Build the Tree**  
   - Construct an **adjacency list** from `edges` to represent the tree.
  
2. **Find Bobâ€™s Path**  
   - Use **DFS or BFS** to record the **time taken by Bob** to reach each node.
  
3. **DFS for Aliceâ€™s Best Path**  
   - Perform a **DFS from node `0`** to explore all possible paths.
   - Keep track of Aliceâ€™s current **net income**.
   - If Alice reaches a node where Bob has already passed, she gets **full** amount.
   - If Alice and Bob reach a node **simultaneously**, they split the amount.
   - If Bob **hasnâ€™t yet reached**, Alice gets **full** amount.
   - Stop at **leaf nodes** and update the maximum possible net income.

---

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Building the Tree:** \(O(n)\)
- **Finding Bobâ€™s Path:** \(O(n)\)
- **DFS for Aliceâ€™s Optimal Path:** \(O(n)\)
- **Total Complexity:** \(O(n)\) (since we process each node a few times)

This approach ensures we **efficiently** compute the maximum net income for Alice. ðŸš€
