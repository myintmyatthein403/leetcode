To solve this problem, we need to find a binary string of length `n` that is **not** present in the given array `nums`, which contains `n` unique binary strings of length `n`.

### **Understanding the Problem Constraints**
1. Each string in `nums` is a unique binary string of length `n`.
2. There are exactly `n` binary strings in the input.
3. We need to generate a binary string of length `n` that is missing from `nums`.
4. If multiple solutions exist, we can return any one of them.

### **Observations**
- The total number of possible binary strings of length `n` is `2^n`.
- Given that `nums` contains only `n` unique strings (where `n < 2^n` for `n > 1`), there must be at least one missing binary string.
- Our goal is to efficiently find one such missing string.

### **Approach**
#### **Method 1: Using a Set for Quick Lookup**
1. **Convert `nums` into a set** for O(1) lookups.
2. **Iterate over all possible binary strings of length `n`**, and check if any of them are missing from `nums`:
   - Generate each binary string from `"000...0"` to `"111...1"` (i.e., numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1` in binary).
   - If a binary string is not in `nums`, return it.
3. **Complexity**:  
   - Constructing the set takes **O(n)**.
   - Checking up to `2^n` binary numbers takes **O(2^n)** in the worst case.
   - Overall, this approach is **O(2^n)**, but works efficiently for small values of `n`.

#### **Method 2: Diagonalization Approach (Greedy Construction)**
Inspired by Cantor's diagonal argument:
1. Construct a new binary string by ensuring that **it differs from each string at its corresponding index**:
   - For each index `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, take the `i`-th character of `nums[i]` and flip it (`'0'` to `'1'` or `'1'` to `'0'`).
   - This guarantees that the constructed string is different from every string in `nums` at least at one position.
2. Since there are `n` strings but `2^n` possibilities, the generated string must be missing from `nums`.
3. **Complexity**:
   - Constructing the string takes **O(n)**, making it highly efficient.

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Example 1: nums = ["01", "10"]**
1. Using **diagonalization**, we construct:
   - `nums[0][0] = "0"`, flip to `"1"`, â†’ first char is `"1"`.
   - `nums[1][1] = "0"`, flip to `"1"`, â†’ second char is `"1"`.
   - Result: `"11"` (valid and missing).

#### **Example 2: nums = ["00", "01"]**
1. Using **diagonalization**:
   - `nums[0][0] = "0"`, flip to `"1"`, â†’ first char is `"1"`.
   - `nums[1][1] = "1"`, flip to `"0"`, â†’ second char is `"0"`.
   - Result: `"10"` (valid and missing).

#### **Example 3: nums = ["111", "011", "001"]**
1. Using **diagonalization**:
   - `nums[0][0] = "1"`, flip to `"0"`, â†’ first char is `"0"`.
   - `nums[1][1] = "1"`, flip to `"0"`, â†’ second char is `"0"`.
   - `nums[2][2] = "1"`, flip to `"0"`, â†’ third char is `"0"`.
   - Result: `"000"` (valid and missing).

### **Conclusion**
- **Diagonalization is the most efficient method** (O(n)).
- **Set-based lookup is also a valid approach**, but can be slower for large `n` (O(2^n)).
- **The problem is always solvable**, since `n < 2^n` guarantees missing strings.

Thus, an optimal and simple way to solve it is by constructing a binary string using **diagonalization**. ðŸš€
