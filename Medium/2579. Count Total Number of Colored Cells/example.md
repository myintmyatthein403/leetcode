This problem's pattern of expansion is similar to real-world scenarios where growth occurs symmetrically outward from a central point. Here are two real-world examples:

### **1. Fire or Epidemic Spread Simulation**  
   - When a fire starts at a single point (e.g., a forest fire) or a disease spreads from an initial infected person, the affected area grows outward in a similar **diamond-shaped** pattern.
   - Each new unit (tree/person) that is adjacent to an already affected unit gets affected in the next time step.
   - The formula used in this problem can help model the spread over time, estimating how quickly a fire or virus might cover a region.

### **2. Signal Propagation in Wireless Networks**  
   - In wireless communication, a signal from a **central transmitter** spreads outward in a **circular or diamond-shaped manner** (depending on obstacles and interference).
   - The number of affected cells in the grid can represent the increasing coverage of a Wi-Fi router or a mobile network tower.
   - This formula can be used to approximate coverage area over time in simulations.

These examples show how the mathematical model from this problem applies to real-world growth and spread scenarios. ðŸš€
