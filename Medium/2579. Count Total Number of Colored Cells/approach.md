This problem follows a pattern of expansion from a single initial cell. Let's analyze the growth step by step.

### **Observations**:
1. At **minute 1**, we color **1** cell.
2. At **minute 2**, the 4 adjacent cells (top, bottom, left, right) are colored, making the total **5**.
3. At **minute 3**, the pattern continues outward, forming a **diamond shape** with a total of **9** colored cells.

Looking at the pattern:
- **Minute 1**: 1 cell  
- **Minute 2**: 5 cells  
- **Minute 3**: 9 cells  
- **Minute 4**: 13 cells  
- ...

### **Finding the pattern**:
Observing the sequence: **1, 5, 9, 13, ...**, we see that each step increases by **4**.

- Growth pattern:  
  - **n = 1** → **1** cell  
  - **n = 2** → **1 + 4 = 5**  
  - **n = 3** → **5 + 4 = 9**  
  - **n = 4** → **9 + 4 = 13**  
  - **n = 5** → **13 + 4 = 17**  

This suggests a formula:

\[
\text{Total colored cells at minute } n = 1 + 4 \times (1 + 2 + ... + (n-1))
\]

Using the sum formula of the first \( k \) natural numbers:

\[
S_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
\]

The number of colored cells at minute **n** simplifies to:

\[
1 + 4 \times \frac{(n-1) \times n}{2}
\]

### **Time Complexity**:
- Since we can compute the formula directly in **O(1)** time, this approach is efficient.

### **Conclusion**:
The number of colored cells follows a quadratic pattern. The formula allows for direct computation without simulating the grid expansion, making the solution optimal.
