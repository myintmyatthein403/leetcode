Here are **2 real-world software development examples** and **1 web development example** where the logic of **sorting limited, known categories (like the Dutch National Flag problem)** is practically useful:

### 🔧 **Software Development Example 1: Log Level Sorting in System Monitoring Tools**

**Scenario:**
You’re building a log management system (like ELK or Datadog). Logs come in with severity levels:

* `0` → Error
* `1` → Warning
* `2` → Info

**Usage:**
Before displaying or processing, you may want to **group logs by severity** — show errors first, then warnings, then info — for quick triage.
You don’t need full sorting — just **grouping by known categories** efficiently.

### 🧠 **Software Development Example 2: Prioritized Task Queuing in Embedded Systems**

**Scenario:**
In a microcontroller (e.g. in robotics or IoT), you categorize tasks by priority:

* `0` → High priority (e.g. safety shutdowns)
* `1` → Medium priority (e.g. sensor reads)
* `2` → Low priority (e.g. data logging)

**Usage:**
Before executing tasks in a tight loop, you **sort or bucket them in-place** based on priority for better responsiveness and efficiency — critical in systems with very limited memory.

### 🌐 **Web Development Example: Filtering User Content by Status**

**Scenario:**
In a content management system (CMS) or admin panel, posts are marked:

* `0` → Draft
* `1` → Published
* `2` → Archived

**Usage:**
When displaying the list of posts, you might want to group or order them by status — showing **Drafts first (for editors), then Published, then Archived** — without running expensive sorting logic or relying on database queries.

**Why use in-place sorting?**

* Faster UX for local filtering
* Reduces the need for multiple requests to the backend
* Works well with real-time updates (e.g. when a status changes)
