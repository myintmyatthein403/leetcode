To solve this problem **efficiently**, the key is to **maximize the number of player-trainer pairings**, where each player can be matched to **one** trainer whose capacity is **greater than or equal to** the player’s ability.

### 🔍 Core Idea

This is essentially a **greedy matching** problem between two arrays, where we want to match the **smallest available player** with the **smallest available trainer** who can train them — because using large-capacity trainers for low-ability players early might prevent higher-ability players from finding a match later.

### ✅ Greedy + Two-Pointer Approach (Concept)

1. **Sort both arrays**:

   * Sort `players` in ascending order of ability.
   * Sort `trainers` in ascending order of training capacity.

2. **Use two pointers**:

   * One pointer (`i`) for `players`, and another (`j`) for `trainers`.
   * Move through both arrays:

     * If `players[i] <= trainers[j]`, it means this trainer can train this player — match them and move both pointers forward.
     * If not, it means the trainer is **not strong enough** for the player — move only the `trainer` pointer forward to find a stronger one.

3. **Count how many such matches** you can form as you go.

### 💡 Why This Works

* By sorting both arrays, you're always attempting to match the **least capable player** with the **least capable trainer** that can still handle them.
* This avoids "wasting" strong trainers on weak players early and saves them for stronger players later.

### ⏱️ Time Complexity

* Sorting takes `O(n log n + m log m)` where `n = len(players)` and `m = len(trainers)`.
* Two-pointer traversal is `O(n + m)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
**`O(n log n + m log m)`**, which is optimal for inputs up to `10^5`.
