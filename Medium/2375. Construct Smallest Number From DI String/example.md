The logic behind this problem can be applied in real-world scenarios where **ordering constraints** must be maintained efficiently. Here are two real-world use cases:

---

### **1. Task Scheduling with Dependencies (Topological Ordering)**
#### **Scenario:**
Imagine a project management tool where tasks must be executed in a specific order based on dependencies. Some tasks should be completed before others (like `"D"` for decreasing priority), while others can be started immediately (like `"I"` for increasing priority).

#### **Application of the Algorithm:**
- Each task is assigned a **unique priority number** (smallest available).
- A **stack is used** to track dependencies.
- When a task dependency is resolved (`"I"` case), the system pops the stack and schedules those tasks first.
- Ensures the **smallest lexicographical task sequence** while maintaining dependency constraints.

âœ… **Example:**  
A sequence of `"DID"` might represent tasks that require **delayed execution until a dependency is resolved**.

### **2. Numbering Sections in Outlined Reports or Documents**
#### **Scenario:**
In an automatically generated document (e.g., a report, book, or legal document), sections are numbered based on hierarchy:
- **"D" (Decreasing Order)** â†’ Subsections must be numbered before moving to the next section.
- **"I" (Increasing Order)** â†’ Move to the next section.

#### **Application of the Algorithm:**
- Each section gets the smallest available number.
- Using a **stack**, numbers are stored for subsections and popped when needed.
- Guarantees the **smallest lexicographical numbering** while following document structure.

âœ… **Example:**  
A pattern like `"DIDI"` would generate:
- `2.1 â†’ 1.1 â†’ 1.2 â†’ 3`
- Ensures that nested sections appear in the correct order.

### **Key Takeaways**
Both examples demonstrate how this approach **efficiently processes sequential constraints**, ensuring correctness while keeping the output **smallest and well-structured**. ðŸš€
