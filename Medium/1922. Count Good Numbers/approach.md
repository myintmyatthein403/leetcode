To solve this problem, let's break it down logically and mathematically rather than diving straight into code.

### 🔍 Problem Understanding

You're given a digit string of length `n`. A digit string is considered **good** if:
- **Even indices (0, 2, 4, ...)** contain **even digits**: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} → **5 options**
- **Odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...)** contain **prime digits**: {2, 3, 5, 7} → **4 options**

You're asked to find how many such **good** strings of length `n` exist.

### 🧠 Key Observations

1. The total number of positions is `n`.
2. Out of those:
   - The number of even indices is `(n + 1) // 2`
   - The number of odd indices is `n // 2`

Example:
- `n = 1` → even indices: 1, odd indices: 0
- `n = 2` → even indices: 1, odd indices: 1
- `n = 3` → even indices: 2, odd indices: 1

So we count how many options we have for each position:
- For every even index: 5 choices (even digits)
- For every odd index: 4 choices (prime digits)

### 🧮 Mathematical Formula

The **total number of good digit strings** is:

```
total = (5 ^ even_positions) * (4 ^ odd_positions)
```

Where:
- `even_positions = (n + 1) // 2`
- `odd_positions = n // 2`

Since the number can be **very large**, you return the result modulo **10⁹ + 7**

### 🏁 Summary of Steps

1. Count how many even and odd indices there are.
2. Calculate:
   - `5` raised to the power of even indices
   - `4` raised to the power of odd indices
3. Multiply the two results
4. Return the result modulo `10⁹ + 7`
