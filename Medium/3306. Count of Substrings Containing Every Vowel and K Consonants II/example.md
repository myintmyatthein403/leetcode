Here are two real-world examples where a similar approach (using a sliding window and frequency tracking) could be applied:

### 1. **Text Analysis for Keyword or Phrase Extraction**
   - **Scenario**: In a content management system or search engine, you may want to analyze a body of text (like an article, blog post, or social media post) to extract substrings or keywords that contain a specific number of occurrences of certain types of words or characters.
   - **Example Use Case**: Let’s say we need to identify all substrings of a given article that contain exactly 3 occurrences of the keyword "product" and all 5 specific categories of words (like adjectives, verbs, nouns, etc.).
   - **How the Approach Fits**: 
     - You could use the sliding window technique to dynamically track the words as you move through the text.
     - The window would expand as you move from left to right across the text and shrink when the keyword count exceeds the required number.
     - The approach would ensure that, at each step, you’re efficiently counting the occurrences of the target words or categories and adjusting the window as needed.
     - This approach allows for fast analysis of large bodies of text without needing to recompute counts for every substring repeatedly.

### 2. **Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions**
   - **Scenario**: In fraud detection systems, you might need to analyze a sequence of financial transactions for a user and identify when certain conditions (like spending patterns or specific activity) are met within a sliding window of transactions.
   - **Example Use Case**: Suppose a bank needs to monitor the last 10 transactions of a user to detect suspicious activity, such as when a certain threshold of "high-value transactions" (e.g., more than $1000) occurs, combined with a certain number of "out-of-region" purchases (indicating potential fraud).
   - **How the Approach Fits**:
     - The sliding window approach can be used to track the last 10 transactions.
     - You can maintain a count of "high-value" and "out-of-region" transactions as you slide the window forward (i.e., as new transactions come in and old ones are discarded).
     - Whenever a window meets the conditions (e.g., 3 high-value and 5 out-of-region transactions), it could trigger an alert.
     - This method allows for real-time processing of transactions and reduces the need to scan the entire transaction history every time, enabling faster fraud detection and response.

In both examples, the sliding window with frequency tracking helps efficiently manage and analyze dynamic data streams or sequences, ensuring that conditions are checked and updated in real-time without unnecessary recomputation.
