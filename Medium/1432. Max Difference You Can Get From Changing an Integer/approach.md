To solve this problem, the goal is to **maximize the difference** between two numbers (`a` and `b`) that are formed by **digit replacement** in the original number `num`.

### Key Observations:

* You can **only replace one digit** at a time per operation.
* The same digit (`x`) is replaced **everywhere it occurs**.
* Leading zeros are not allowed (so replacement can't make the number start with 0).
* You want to **maximize `a - b`** where both `a` and `b` are derived from `num`.

### Strategy:

We can think in terms of two transformations:

#### 1. **Maximizing `a`** (make the number as large as possible):

* Goal: Replace a digit `x` in `num` with a digit `y = 9` to **maximize the value**.
* Idea: Replace the **leftmost digit that is not 9** with 9 and do this for **all its occurrences**.
* Why this works: Making higher digits (more significant positions) bigger increases the number more.

#### 2. **Minimizing `b`** (make the number as small as possible):

* Goal: Replace a digit `x` in `num` with a **smaller digit**, ideally as small as possible (but without introducing a leading 0).
* Idea:

  * If the **first digit** (most significant digit) is not 1, replace it with 1 (since leading digit must be ≥1).
  * Otherwise, replace any other digit that is not 0 or 1 with 0 to shrink the number.

### Steps to Approach:

1. Convert `num` to a string so we can examine and manipulate digits.
2. For maximizing `a`:

   * Find the **first digit** that is not 9.
   * Replace **all instances** of that digit with 9.
3. For minimizing `b`:

   * If the **first digit** is not 1, replace it with 1 (and all its occurrences).
   * Otherwise, look for the **first non-0 digit** (after the first digit) that is not 1, and replace all of that digit with 0.
4. Convert both new strings to integers and compute `a - b`.

### Example:

Let’s take `num = 555`:

* To maximize: Replace 5 with 9 ⇒ `a = 999`
* To minimize: Replace 5 with 1 ⇒ `b = 111`
* Result: `999 - 111 = 888`

Let’s take `num = 9288`:

* Maximize: Replace 2 with 9 ⇒ `9988`
* Minimize: Replace 8 with 0 ⇒ `9200`
* Result: `9988 - 9200 = 788`

---

### Summary:

The core idea is to:

* Make the number **as big as possible** once.
* Make the number **as small as possible** once.
  Then take the **difference** between the two.

This ensures the maximum possible difference you can get with the allowed single-digit replacement operation done twice independently.
