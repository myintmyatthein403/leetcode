1. **Encryption and Decryption:**
   - **Scenario:** You are developing a simple encryption algorithm for a messaging app. Each message needs to be encrypted by shifting the letters based on a series of operations.
   - **Usage:**
     ```javascript
     let message = "hello";
     let shifts = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 3, 0], [2, 4, 1]];
     let encryptedMessage = shiftingLetters(message, shifts);
     console.log(encryptedMessage); // Encrypted message
     ```

2. **Game Development:**
   - **Scenario:** In a word puzzle game, you need to implement a feature where certain letters in a word can be shifted based on player actions or game events.
   - **Usage:**
     ```javascript
     let word = "puzzle";
     let shifts = [[0, 2, 1], [3, 5, 0], [1, 4, 1]];
     let newWord = shiftingLetters(word, shifts);
     console.log(newWord); // New word after applying shifts
     ```

These examples demonstrate how the `shiftingLetters` function can be applied in different contexts to manipulate strings based on a series of shift operations.
