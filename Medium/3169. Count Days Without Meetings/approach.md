Let's break down the approach to solve this problem.

**Understanding the Problem**

The core task is to determine the days within a given range (1 to `days`) that are *not* occupied by any meetings. We're given a list of meetings, each with a start and end day, and we need to identify the gaps.

**General Approach**

1.  **Representing Busy Days:**
    * We need a way to track which days are occupied by meetings. A simple approach is to use a boolean array or a set to represent the days.
    * For example, a boolean array `busyDays` of size `days + 1` (to account for days 1 to `days`) can be used. If `busyDays[i]` is `true`, it means day `i` is busy.

2.  **Marking Busy Days:**
    * Iterate through the `meetings` array.
    * For each meeting `[start_i, end_i]`, mark all days from `start_i` to `end_i` (inclusive) as busy in the `busyDays` array or add them to the busy day set.

3.  **Counting Free Days:**
    * Iterate through the days from 1 to `days`.
    * For each day, check if it's marked as busy.
    * If it's *not* busy, increment a counter for free days.

4.  **Returning the Count:**
    * Return the final count of free days.

**Detailed Explanation**

1.  **Initialization:**
    * Create a boolean array `busyDays` of size `days + 1`, initialized with `false` (or an empty set).

2.  **Marking Busy Days:**
    * Loop through the `meetings` array.
    * For each meeting `[start_i, end_i]`:
        * Loop from `start_i` to `end_i` (inclusive).
        * Set `busyDays[j]` to `true` for each `j` in the range (or add j to the set).

3.  **Counting Free Days:**
    * Initialize a `freeDays` counter to 0.
    * Loop from `i = 1` to `days`.
    * If `busyDays[i]` is `false` (or if i is not in the set), increment `freeDays`.

4.  **Return:**
    * Return the value of `freeDays`.

**Example Walkthrough (Example 1)**

* `days = 10`, `meetings = [[5, 7], [1, 3], [9, 10]]`
* `busyDays` (initially all `false`): `[false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]`
* Marking busy days:
    * `[5, 7]`: `busyDays` becomes `[false, false, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, false]`
    * `[1,3]`: `busyDays` becomes `[false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false]`
    * `[9,10]`: `busyDays` becomes `[false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, true, true]`
* Counting free days: days 4 and 8 are false, so the count is 2.
* Return 2.
