To solve the **count-and-say** problem, here's the approach and explanation—no code involved:

---

### 🔁 Core Idea:
The sequence is generated **recursively**, starting from `"1"` and building each term by "reading aloud" the digits of the previous term using **run-length encoding** logic. But instead of encoding for compression, we describe how many times each digit appears consecutively.

---

### 💡 Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Start with the base case:**
   - `countAndSay(1)` = `"1"`.

2. **Generate the sequence iteratively:**
   - For each number from `2` to `n`, take the previous result and "say" what you see:
     - Look at the previous string digit by digit.
     - Count how many times each digit appears consecutively.
     - Convert that group into a new string using the format: **(count followed by digit)**.

3. **Example Breakdown:**
   - `countAndSay(1)` = `"1"`  
   - `countAndSay(2)` → One `"1"` → `"11"`  
   - `countAndSay(3)` → Two `"1"`s → `"21"`  
   - `countAndSay(4)` → One `"2"`, One `"1"` → `"1211"`  
   - `countAndSay(5)` → One `"1"`, One `"2"`, Two `"1"`s → `"111221"`

4. **Repeat this process until you reach the nth term.**

---

### 🔍 Key Concept – “Say What You See”:
At each step, you don’t interpret the number as a value but as a **sequence of digits**. You simply describe what you see:
- `"111221"` is “three 1s, two 2s, one 1” → `"312211"`

---

### ✅ Final Output:
After looping through this process up to `n`, the final string is the `n`th element in the sequence.
