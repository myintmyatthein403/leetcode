Here are **two real-world applications** where finding Fibonacci-like subsequences can be useful:

### **1. Financial Market Trend Analysis ðŸ“ˆ**
- **Use Case:** In stock market analysis, traders look for patterns in historical prices to predict future trends.
- **Example:**  
  - Given a time series of stock prices, identifying Fibonacci-like sequences can help detect natural growth patterns.
  - Some price movements may follow a Fibonacci-like progression (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...%) based on investor sentiment and technical analysis.
  - This can be useful for momentum trading or forecasting potential price levels.

### **2. Genetic Sequence Analysis ðŸ§¬**
- **Use Case:** In bioinformatics, DNA and protein sequences often follow structured patterns.  
- **Example:**  
  - Given a dataset of gene expressions, researchers may analyze subsequences to find evolutionary relationships.
  - If certain mutations or genetic structures follow a Fibonacci-like pattern, it could indicate a **natural selection process** or an **evolutionary advantage**.
  - Such patterns may help in drug discovery, disease prediction, or evolutionary biology.
