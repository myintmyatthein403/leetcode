To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence in a given strictly increasing array. Here's the structured approach:

### **Approach**
1. **Use a HashSet for Fast Lookups**  
   - Since we need to check whether a Fibonacci condition holds (`xi + xi+1 == xi+2`), a **HashSet** can help verify the existence of elements in `O(1)` time.

2. **Use a HashMap for Dynamic Programming**  
   - Define `dp[i][j]` as the **length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence** ending at indices `i` and `j`.  
   - Instead of checking all possible subsequences, we efficiently build upon known values.

3. **Iterate Over Pairs to Build Subsequences**  
   - Fix two indices `(i, j)`, where `i < j`, and determine if there exists an index `k < i` such that `arr[k] + arr[i] = arr[j]`.
   - Use a **HashMap** to store previous index lookups for quick validation.

4. **Update the DP Table Efficiently**  
   - If `arr[k] + arr[i] == arr[j]`, update `dp[i][j] = dp[k][i] + 1` to extend the sequence.
   - Track the maximum length found.

5. **Edge Cases**  
   - If no Fibonacci-like sequence is found, return `0`.
   - Handle cases where no valid triplet exists.

### **Time Complexity**
- **O(NÂ²)**: Each pair `(i, j)` is processed once with a lookup in a HashMap, making it efficient.
