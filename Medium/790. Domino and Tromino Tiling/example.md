Here are **2 real-world examples** and **1 web development example** where a similar approach to **domino and tromino tiling** (i.e., dynamic tiling and coverage problems) is used:

### ✅ **Real-World Example 1: Floor Planning in Robotics**

**Scenario:**
In robotics (e.g., vacuum robots or warehouse robots), algorithms plan how to completely cover a 2D floor grid using specific movement units or coverage patterns.

**Similarity to the problem:**

* The robot can cover 1 or more grid units at a time using "tiles" that resemble movement patterns.
* You need to calculate the number of ways to cover a space fully with these movement units, similar to tiling the `2 x n` board.
* Dynamic programming helps avoid re-computing the same sub-floor plan combinations.

### ✅ **Real-World Example 2: Puzzle Design and Manufacturing**

**Scenario:**
Designing or manufacturing tiling-based puzzles or wooden floor boards with restricted shapes (e.g., Tetris blocks, L-shapes, dominoes).

**Similarity to the problem:**

* You are given specific shapes and must fit them into a rectangular board without gaps.
* You want to find all valid ways to fill the area, respecting shape orientation and rotation.
* Useful for automated layout generation or even optimization in cutting material.

### ✅ **Web Development Example: Grid-Based Layout Engine**

**Scenario:**
A web app or CMS (Content Management System) allows users to drag and drop **blocks** (like image cards, ads, widgets) into a page layout.

**Similarity to the problem:**

* Each block may occupy different dimensions (e.g., `2x1`, `L-shape`).
* The engine must calculate and offer all valid placements of blocks into a grid without overlap.
* Uses a variation of tiling logic to determine how components can fit — dynamic programming can assist in efficient computation of valid layout options.
