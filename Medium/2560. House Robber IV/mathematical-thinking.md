### **Logical Approach (Mathematical Thinking)**  

We are given a series of numbers (representing money in houses) and must choose **at least** `k` of them while ensuring no two adjacent numbers are picked. The goal is to **minimize the maximum** value among the chosen numbers.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Constraint**  
- We cannot pick two consecutive numbers.  
- We must pick at least `k` numbers.  
- The objective is to minimize the **largest** number in our selection.

---

### **Step 2: Defining the Search Space**  
- The **maximum value in any selection** determines the **capability** (i.e., the highest number the robber will be forced to take).  
- The possible range of this capability is between the **smallest number** (best case) and the **largest number** (worst case) in the list.  
- Our task is to find the smallest possible **maximum** among valid selections.

---

### **Step 3: Testing Feasibility of a Given Capability**  
- Suppose we fix a **maximum limit (`X`)** and only consider numbers `â‰¤ X`.  
- Can we still select at least `k` numbers while following the **non-adjacent selection rule**?  
- We move through the list greedily, selecting numbers when possible while skipping adjacent ones.  
- If we can pick `k` numbers successfully, then `X` is a valid capability.

---

### **Step 4: Finding the Minimum Valid Capability**  
- We systematically test different values of `X` using a method similar to **binary search**:
  1. Start with the smallest (`min(nums)`) and largest (`max(nums)`) possible values.
  2. Check if the middle value is a feasible capability.
  3. If it is possible, try a smaller value (to minimize it further).
  4. If not possible, increase the limit.
  5. Eventually, we reach the **smallest valid capability**.

---

### **Mathematical Intuition**  
- The solution finds the **smallest maximum value** among all possible valid selections.  
- It efficiently **narrows down the search** instead of checking every possible subset (which would be too slow).  
- The process is **logarithmic** due to binary search and **linear** due to greedy selection, making it highly efficient.

This logical structure applies to real-world problems like **risk minimization, load balancing, and constrained optimization.**
