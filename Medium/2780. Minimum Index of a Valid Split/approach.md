Let's break down how to approach this problem.

**Understanding the Problem**

The core challenge is to find the earliest point where splitting the `nums` array results in two subarrays that share the same dominant element as the original `nums` array.

**Approach**

1.  **Find the Dominant Element:**
    * First, we need to determine the dominant element in the original `nums` array. We can do this by counting the occurrences of each element and identifying the one that appears more than `n / 2` times, where `n` is the length of `nums`.

2.  **Iterate and Split:**
    * We'll iterate through the `nums` array from index 1 up to `n - 1`. For each index `i`, we'll:
        * Split `nums` into two subarrays: `left` (from index 0 to `i`) and `right` (from index `i + 1` to `n - 1`).
        * Determine the dominant element in both `left` and `right` subarrays.
        * Check if the dominant elements of `left`, `right`, and the original `nums` are the same. If they are, we've found a valid split.

3.  **Dominant Element Check in Subarrays:**
    * To determine the dominant element in a subarray, we'll use the same counting method as in step 1.

4.  **Minimum Index:**
    * Since we're iterating from the beginning, the first valid split we find will be the one with the minimum index.

5.  **No Valid Split:**
    * If we iterate through the entire array without finding a valid split, we'll return `-1`.

**Key Considerations**

* **Efficiency:** We need to be mindful of the time complexity. Repeatedly calculating the dominant element in subarrays can be costly. We can optimize this by keeping track of counts as we iterate.
* **Edge cases:** empty arrays or arrays with only one element do not have valid splits.
