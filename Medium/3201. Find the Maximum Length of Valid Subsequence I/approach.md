To solve **Leetcode 3201: Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I**, let's understand and break down the problem logically.

---

## üß† Problem Understanding:

You're given an array `nums`. You want to **find the longest subsequence** such that:

```text
(sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 ==
(sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 ==
...
(sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2
```

In simpler terms:

* For every adjacent **pair** in the subsequence, their **sum's parity (even/odd)** must be the same.

So, in any valid subsequence:

* Each **pair of adjacent elements** must **produce the same parity** when summed.

---

## üéØ Goal:

Return the **length** of the longest such subsequence.

---

## üß© Insight:

There are **two parities**:

* **Even (0 mod 2)**
* **Odd (1 mod 2)**

### Key Observations:

1. The parity of `(a + b) % 2` depends on the parity of `a` and `b`:

   * Even + Even ‚Üí Even
   * Odd + Odd ‚Üí Even
   * Even + Odd ‚Üí Odd
   * Odd + Even ‚Üí Odd

2. So the **parity of the sum** is:

   * `0` if both numbers have the same parity.
   * `1` if they have different parity.

This means:

> The **pattern of evenness/oddness** (parity) of adjacent numbers must be **consistent** throughout the subsequence.

---

## üîç Strategy (Greedy Approach):

We want the **longest subsequence** where **every adjacent pair of elements produces the same sum parity**.

This leads to two main cases:

### Case 1: Choose subsequence where adjacent elements have **same parity**

* i.e., (even, even, even) or (odd, odd, odd)
* Sum parity will always be even

### Case 2: Choose subsequence where adjacent elements have **alternating parity**

* i.e., (odd, even, odd, even...) or (even, odd, even, odd...)
* Sum parity will always be odd

We can greedily:

* Try to build the longest subsequence of type **Case 1** (same parity)
* Or of type **Case 2** (alternating parity)

---

## üßÆ Efficient Approach:

1. Traverse the array and try to **greedily build the longest subsequence** with:

   * A fixed sum parity (either always even or always odd)
   * Check by trying both options:

     * Fix target parity = 0 (even)
     * Fix target parity = 1 (odd)

2. At each step, decide whether to include the current number:

   * For the first element: include it
   * For next elements: include if it produces the **target sum parity** with the last included element

3. Keep track of the **last picked number** in the subsequence.

4. Finally, return the maximum length from the two strategies.

---

## üß† Final Intuition:

* The problem is about finding a **uniform pattern** in the parity of sums of adjacent elements in a subsequence.
* By testing both even and odd parity targets, and greedily constructing the longest possible subsequence for each, we guarantee the correct result.

Let me know if you'd like the code for this greedy approach.
