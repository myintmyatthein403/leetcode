Here are **2 real-world examples** and **1 web development example** where the logic behind **minimizing uniformity with rotation/switching** applies, similar to the domino rotation problem:

### ✅ **Real-World Example 1: Standardizing Cable Connectors in Manufacturing**

**Scenario:**
In an electronics factory, each device has two ports (e.g., top and bottom), and each port may support different cable standards (like USB-A, USB-C). The goal is to configure the devices such that **one single connector type** is used across all devices, possibly by rotating/swapping the port positions.

**Similarity:**

* Like tops/bottoms of dominoes, devices have two options.
* The factory wants **minimum reconfigurations (rotations)** to make all devices support the same port at the same position.
* If no single connector can be used on all devices, it’s **impossible**, like returning `-1`.

### ✅ **Real-World Example 2: Uniform Badge Display in an Event**

**Scenario:**
Conference attendees wear badges with their company logo and name — printed on both sides, but not always in the same order. Organizers want every badge to display the **company name** on top, for consistency in group photos, with the **fewest possible flips**.

**Similarity:**

* Top/bottom are like the two sides of the badge.
* Some badges may already be in correct order; others need flipping.
* Count the minimum number of flips to achieve uniform top display.

### ✅ **Web Development Example: Theme Synchronization in Multi-Component UI**

**Scenario:**
A dashboard app has multiple widgets. Each widget can be configured to show a **dark or light theme** (user-controlled). For UX consistency, the app might want to auto-apply a **uniform theme** across all widgets with the **least manual adjustments** by the user.

**Similarity:**

* Each widget has 2 possible states (light/dark).
* Determine which theme (if any) can be applied universally.
* Flip only those widgets that don’t match, minimizing changes.
* If no single theme fits all widgets (due to fixed restrictions), the system must reject the uniform setting (`-1` equivalent).
