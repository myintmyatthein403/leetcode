To solve this domino rotation problem, the key idea is to **find a number (from 1 to 6)** that could **potentially fill all elements** of either the top or bottom row (after rotation if necessary), and then compute the **minimum number of rotations** required to achieve that.

---

### ‚úÖ **Core Insight:**

For a number `x` (from 1 to 6) to be a valid candidate:

* It **must appear in every domino**, either on the top or the bottom (or both).
* If for any domino `i`, neither `tops[i]` nor `bottoms[i]` equals `x`, then `x` **cannot be the target**.

---

### üß† **Approach:**

1. **Pick Candidates to Check:**

   * Only check two potential candidates: `tops[0]` and `bottoms[0]`.

     * Why? If a value is to be made uniform across the entire row, it must be present in every domino ‚Äî and since we can rotate each domino, the only numbers that could work are ones seen in the **first domino**.

2. **For Each Candidate:**

   * Traverse all dominoes.
   * Count how many rotations you'd need to make all `tops` equal to `x`.
   * Count how many rotations you'd need to make all `bottoms` equal to `x`.
   * Skip if the value `x` doesn‚Äôt appear in either half of any domino.

3. **Return the Minimum Rotations:**

   * Among all valid options, return the **minimum number of rotations** needed.
   * If no number works for all dominoes, return `-1`.

### üß© Example Breakdown:

**Input:**
`tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2]`
`bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]`

Check candidate `2`:

* It appears in every domino in at least one side.
* Count how many rotations needed to make all `tops` or all `bottoms` equal to `2`.
* Result: minimum rotations = 2.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Case:

If for some index `i`, the value you're trying to align (`x`) is in **neither** `tops[i]` nor `bottoms[i]`, it's **impossible** ‚Äî immediately skip or return `-1`.
