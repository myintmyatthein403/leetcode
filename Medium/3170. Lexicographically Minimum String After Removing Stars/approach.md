To solve **[3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-minimum-string-after-removing-stars/)** effectively, let‚Äôs break down the **goal and approach**.

---

## üß† Problem Understanding

Given a string `s` that contains lowercase letters and `'*'` characters, each `'*'` must be removed **along with one of the smallest non-`'*'` characters to its left**.

### Important rules:

* Always remove the **leftmost `'*'`** available.
* Remove the **smallest character to the left** of that `'*'` (among those not yet deleted).
* If there are **multiple smallest characters**, you can delete any.

Your task is to return the final string after all `'*'` are removed and each one has deleted a letter to its left.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Observations

1. Each `'*'` removes one letter from the left.
2. Your final string will only contain letters that:

   * Were never deleted,
   * Were not removed by a `'*'`.
3. The **order** of characters must be preserved, but we want the **lexicographically smallest** possible result among all valid deletions.

---

## üß≠ Strategy / Approach

Use a **stack-based greedy approach** to simulate the process, always choosing the best (lex smallest) option **locally** for removal.

### Steps:

1. **Iterate over characters in `s` from left to right.**
2. Use a **stack** to keep track of the current characters.
3. For each character:

   * If it's a **letter**, push it onto the stack.
   * If it's a `'*'`:

     * You must remove one of the characters already in the stack.
     * To make the result **lexicographically smallest**, remove the **smallest character** among those in the stack.
     * But remember: once removed, we **don‚Äôt add `'*'` to the result**, just delete it and the character.
4. Finally, build the resulting string from what's left in the stack.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why the Greedy Stack Works

* By using a **stack**, we maintain the original order.
* We make **greedy deletions** of the smallest available character when needed.
* Deleting the smallest available character ensures **lex minimality**.

---

## üì¶ Summary

* Use a **stack** to store current valid characters.
* When encountering a `'*'`, remove the **smallest character to the left** (this is the tricky part‚Äîhow to efficiently find it).
* Return the final stack as the result.

If you want to dive deeper into optimization (like handling `'*'` with priority queues or frequency counts to make the smallest choice faster), I can walk you through that too.
