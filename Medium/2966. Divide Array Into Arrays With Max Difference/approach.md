To solve the problem **"Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference"**, here is a clear and effective **approach and explanation** (without code):

---

### 🔍 Problem Breakdown

You're given:

* An array `nums` of size `n` (where `n % 3 == 0`)
* An integer `k`

Your task is:

* Divide `nums` into `n / 3` groups of **exactly 3 elements**
* Each group must satisfy: the **maximum difference between any two elements in the group is ≤ k**
* Return any valid 2D array with the grouped elements
* If it's impossible to group like that, return `[]`

---

### ✅ Key Insight

To satisfy the max difference constraint, **grouping similar numbers together increases the chance** of staying within the `k` threshold.

---

### 🧠 Strategy

#### Step 1: **Sort the Array**

Why? Because grouping **consecutive/similar numbers** increases the chance that their differences are small. Sorting helps efficiently form valid triplets.

#### Step 2: **Greedily Form Triplets**

Iterate through the sorted list and:

* Try to pick **every 3 consecutive elements** as a group
* Check the **difference between max and min** in each triplet (which are the first and third element, since the list is sorted)
* If the difference is > `k`, the triplet is invalid → **return empty list**

Why greedy? Because after sorting, the smallest possible differences will appear first, so if we can't form valid triplets in this order, we **won’t be able to later either**.

#### Step 3: **Return Result**

Once you've formed all `n / 3` valid triplets, return them as the result.

---

### ❌ Why Might It Fail?

If **any triplet** has a max difference > `k`, the grouping is invalid, and it's impossible to divide `nums` accordingly → return `[]`.

Example:
`nums = [2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5]`, `k = 2`
Even though you can make `[2, 2, 2]`, the remaining `[2, 4, 5]` has `5 - 2 = 3 > k` → so it's invalid.

---

### 💡 Time & Space Complexity

* **Time**: O(n log n) — due to sorting
* **Space**: O(n) — for storing the result

### Summary

| Step | Action                                                                |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Sort the `nums` array                                                 |
| 2    | Group every 3 elements from left to right                             |
| 3    | For each triplet, check if `max - min <= k`                           |
| 4    | If all triplets are valid → return them; else → return an empty array |

This greedy + sorting method guarantees correctness and efficiency.
