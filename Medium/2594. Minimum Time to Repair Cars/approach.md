To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the total time required to repair all the cars while considering the constraints:

### Key Observations:
1. **Time Calculation for Each Mechanic**:
   - The time for a mechanic with rank `r` to repair `n` cars is calculated as `r * n^2`. This means that the mechanic with the lower rank will repair cars more efficiently (since `n^2` grows quickly).
   
2. **Simultaneous Work**:
   - All mechanics work simultaneously, so the goal is to distribute the work (i.e., the repair of cars) among the mechanics in such a way that the total repair time is minimized.
   
3. **Task Distribution**:
   - The key challenge here is to distribute the cars in such a way that no mechanic has an excessively large number of cars to repair compared to others, which would result in a high repair time due to the quadratic term in the formula.

### Approach:

#### Binary Search on Time:
Since we are looking to minimize the time, a binary search can help us find the smallest possible time in which all cars can be repaired. Here's how the binary search works:

1. **Define the Search Range**:
   - The minimum possible time (`min_time`) can be `0` (if no cars are to be repaired).
   - The maximum possible time (`max_time`) is the worst case, where the slowest mechanic (with the highest rank) is tasked with repairing all cars, i.e., `max_time = rank_max * cars^2`.

2. **Check Feasibility for a Given Time**:
   - For a given time `T`, check if it's possible to repair all the cars within that time by distributing the cars among the mechanics. For each mechanic with rank `r`, the maximum number of cars they can repair in time `T` is determined by the inequality `r * n^2 <= T`.
   - Solve for `n`: `n <= sqrt(T / r)`. This gives the number of cars a mechanic with rank `r` can repair in time `T`.
   
3. **Greedy Car Distribution**:
   - For each mechanic, calculate how many cars they can repair within the given time and try to assign as many cars as possible until all cars are repaired.
   - If the total number of cars repaired by all mechanics exceeds or equals the total number of cars (`cars`), then the time `T` is feasible.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - Start with the range `min_time = 0` and `max_time` as described above.
   - Perform binary search to narrow down the smallest time `T` where the cars can be repaired within that time.
   - If the time `T` is feasible, try a smaller time (`max_time = T`).
   - If the time `T` is not feasible, try a larger time (`min_time = T + 1`).

#### Complexity Consideration:
- The time complexity for checking if a certain time `T` is feasible is `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of mechanics, as we iterate through each mechanic once.
- The binary search runs in `O(log(max_time))` time.
- Thus, the total complexity is `O(m * log(max_time))`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum time required for all cars to be repaired.
