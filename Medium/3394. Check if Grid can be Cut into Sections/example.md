Let's explore two real-world examples where this type of grid-partitioning logic could be applied:

**1. Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing:**

* **Scenario:** Imagine a cloud service provider managing a data center. They need to allocate server resources (represented as rectangles) to different clients. The data center's infrastructure can be divided into distinct zones (the grid sections) for security, performance, or billing purposes.
* **Application:**
    * The grid represents the data center's resource layout.
    * The rectangles represent the resource allocations for each client.
    * The goal is to find optimal ways to divide the data center into three zones such that each zone has active resource allocations and each client's resources are contained within a single zone.
    * This helps in ensuring that clients' resources are isolated and that each zone is utilized efficiently.
    * The code would help to determine if a valid allocation is possible, and could be expanded to find the optimal cut locations.

**2. Image Processing and Object Segmentation:**

* **Scenario:** In image processing, you might want to segment an image into distinct regions based on the presence of objects. For instance, you might want to isolate foreground objects from the background.
* **Application:**
    * The grid represents the pixel grid of the image.
    * The rectangles represent bounding boxes around detected objects.
    * The goal is to divide the image into three regions using horizontal or vertical cuts, such that each region contains at least one object and each object belongs to a single region.
    * This can be useful for tasks like object recognition, image editing, or content-aware image resizing.
    * The code would allow for the validation of possible cuts, and could be used as part of a larger image processing pipeline.

In both these examples, the core logic of partitioning a grid based on rectangular regions is essential for achieving specific operational or analytical goals.
