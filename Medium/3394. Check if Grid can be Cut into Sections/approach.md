Let's break down this problem and figure out an approach.

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given a grid and a set of non-overlapping rectangles within that grid. Our goal is to determine if we can divide the grid into three sections using either two horizontal or two vertical cuts, such that:

1.  **Each section contains at least one rectangle.**
2.  **Every rectangle belongs to exactly one section.**

**Approach**

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1.  **Iterate through possible cuts:**
    * We'll need to try all possible pairs of horizontal cuts and all possible pairs of vertical cuts.
    * For an $n \times n$ grid, we can make horizontal cuts at $y = 1, 2, ..., n-1$ and vertical cuts at $x = 1, 2, ..., n-1$.

2.  **Check for valid sections:**
    * For each pair of cuts, we'll divide the grid into three sections.
    * We'll then iterate through the rectangles and check if each rectangle falls into exactly one of the three sections.
    * We'll also ensure that each of the three sections contains at least one rectangle.

3.  **Horizontal Cuts:**
    * If we make horizontal cuts at $y_1$ and $y_2$ ($y_1 < y_2$), the three sections will be:
        * $y < y_1$
        * $y_1 \le y < y_2$
        * $y \ge y_2$

4.  **Vertical Cuts:**
    * If we make vertical cuts at $x_1$ and $x_2$ ($x_1 < x_2$), the three sections will be:
        * $x < x_1$
        * $x_1 \le x < x_2$
        * $x \ge x_2$

5.  **Return the result:**
    * If we find a pair of cuts (either horizontal or vertical) that satisfies the conditions, we return `true`.
    * If we try all possible cuts and none satisfy the conditions, we return `false`.

**Key Considerations**

* **Efficiency:** We need to be mindful of the time complexity. Trying all possible pairs of cuts might be computationally expensive for large grids.
* **Edge cases:** We need to consider edge cases, such as when there are very few rectangles or when the rectangles are located at the edges of the grid.

Let me know if you would like me to provide some code examples to illustrate this approach.
