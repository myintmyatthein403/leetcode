To solve this problem, we need to **count the number of subarrays** in which there are **at least `k` pairs** of equal elements, where a pair is defined as `(i, j)` with `i < j` and `arr[i] == arr[j]`.

Here’s the **high-level approach** to efficiently solve this problem:

---

### ✅ **Core Idea: Sliding Window + Two Pointers**

We use a **two-pointer sliding window** approach to count how many subarrays have **at least `k` equal pairs**.

---

### 🧠 **Key Observations**:

1. **Pairs count logic**:  
   If an element appears `freq` times in a window, it contributes `freq * (freq - 1) / 2` pairs (because any two of the same elements make a pair `(i, j)` with `i < j`).

2. **Growing window**:  
   Move the right pointer (`right`) to expand the window and maintain the total number of equal pairs.

3. **Shrinking window**:  
   Once the number of pairs in the current window is **at least `k`**, move the left pointer (`left`) to shrink the window until the condition no longer holds.  
   - Every time the window from `left` to `right` has at least `k` pairs, then **all subarrays starting at `left`, `left+1`, ..., `right`** and ending at `right` are good. So we can count `(n - right)` such subarrays.

### 🧮 **Step-by-step Explanation**:

1. Initialize a **frequency map** (e.g., `freq`) to keep track of how many times each number appears in the current window.

2. Use two pointers:  
   - `left` = start of the window  
   - `right` = end of the window

3. For each `right`:
   - Add `nums[right]` to the frequency map.
   - Increase the **pair count** based on how many times `nums[right]` already appeared.
     - If it appeared `f` times before, it adds `f` new pairs.

4. Once the **pair count ≥ k**, the current window and all windows extending further to the right are good. So:
   - Add `(n - right)` to the result.
   - Then move `left` to reduce the window size and update the frequency and pair count accordingly (until pairs < k again).

5. Continue until the right pointer reaches the end of the array.

### ⏱️ **Time Complexity**:  
**O(n)** — Each element is added and removed from the window at most once.

### 🧪 Example Walkthrough (Short):

For `nums = [1,1,1,1,1]` and `k = 10`:
- Only the full array has 10 pairs (since 5 of the same = 10 pairs: `5*4/2`)
- So, output = `1`

For `nums = [3,1,4,3,2,2,4]` and `k = 2`:
- The algorithm will find all windows that have 2 or more equal pairs and count them as described.
