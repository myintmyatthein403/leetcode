Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the problem in JavaScript:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Create a variable to keep track of the maximum number of fish caught.

2. **Define Helper Function**:
   - Create a helper function to perform Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from a given starting cell.

3. **Iterate Through the Grid**:
   - Loop through each cell in the grid to find all water cells and use them as starting points for the DFS.

4. **DFS Implementation**:
   - In the DFS function, keep track of the number of fish caught.
   - Mark the current cell as visited by setting it to 0.
   - Recursively visit all adjacent water cells.
   - After exploring all paths from the current cell, update the maximum number of fish caught.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Return the maximum number of fish caught.

Here is the JavaScript code implementing the above approach:

```javascript
function getMaximumFish(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    let maxFish = 0;

    const directions = [
        [0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]
    ];

    function dfs(r, c) {
        if (r < 0 || r >= m || c < 0 || c >= n || grid[r][c] === 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        let fish = grid[r][c];
        grid[r][c] = 0; // Mark as visited

        for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
            fish += dfs(r + dr, c + dc);
        }

        return fish;
    }

    for (let r = 0; r < m; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] > 0) {
                maxFish = Math.max(maxFish, dfs(r, c));
            }
        }
    }

    return maxFish;
}

// Example usage:
const grid1 = [[0,2,1,0],[4,0,0,3],[1,0,0,4],[0,3,2,0]];
console.log(getMaximumFish(grid1)); // Output: 7

const grid2 = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1]];
console.log(getMaximumFish(grid2)); // Output: 1
```

This code defines the `getMaximumFish` function which calculates the maximum number of fish that can be caught starting from any water cell in the grid. The `dfs` function is used to explore all possible paths from a given starting cell and accumulate the number of fish caught.
