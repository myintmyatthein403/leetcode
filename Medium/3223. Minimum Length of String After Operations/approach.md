To solve the problem of finding the minimum length of the string after performing the given operations, you can use the following approach:

### Approach
1. **Initialize a Frequency Array**: Create an array of size 26 to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Count Frequencies**: Iterate over the string and update the frequency array based on the character's ASCII value.
3. **Calculate Result**: Traverse the frequency array and calculate the result based on whether the frequency of each character is odd or even.
4. **Return Result**: Return the final result which represents the minimum length of the string after performing the given operations.

### Implementation

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumLength = function(s) {
    // Step 1: Initialize a frequency array of size 26
    let freq = new Array(26).fill(0);

    // Step 2: Iterate over the string and increment the frequency of each character
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        freq[s.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }

    // Step 3: Traverse the frequency array
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (freq[i] % 2 === 1) {
            result += 1;
        } else if (freq[i] > 0) {
            result += 2;
        }
    }

    // Step 4: Return the final result
    return result;
};

// Example usage:
const s1 = "abaacbcbb";
const s2 = "aa";
console.log(minimumLength(s1)); // Expected output: 5
console.log(minimumLength(s2)); // Expected output: 2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialize Frequency Array**: Create an array of size 26 to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Count Frequencies**: Iterate over the string and update the frequency array based on the character's ASCII value.
3. **Calculate Result**: Traverse the frequency array and calculate the result based on whether the frequency of each character is odd or even.
4. **Return Result**: Return the final result which represents the minimum length of the string after performing the given operations.

This approach ensures that the operations are performed efficiently and the minimum length of the string is calculated accurately.
ormed efficiently and the minimum length of the string is achieved.
