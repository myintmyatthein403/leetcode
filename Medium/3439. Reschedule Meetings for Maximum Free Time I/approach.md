To solve **Leetcode 3439: Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time I**, the goal is to **reschedule up to `k` meetings** (maintaining their durations and relative order) **within the event time**, such that the **longest continuous free time** during the event is **maximized**.

---

### üîç **Core Idea**

The key is to **reschedule meetings (by shifting them within allowed limits)** so that they are **more compacted**, creating **larger gaps of free time** elsewhere. Since we can only shift at most `k` meetings, we must **choose wisely which meetings to move**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Approach (Greedy + Sliding Window + Binary Search)**

#### 1. **Preprocessing**

* Calculate durations of each meeting.
* Store the original gaps between meetings and possible flexibility (how far a meeting can be shifted without breaking constraints).

#### 2. **Binary Search on Free Time**

* The goal is to find the **maximum possible continuous free interval**.
* Use binary search over the answer: free time can range from `0` to `eventTime`.
* For each `mid` (candidate longest free time), **check if it's possible** to get such a gap by shifting at most `k` meetings.

#### 3. **Feasibility Check for a Given Free Time**

* Sliding window over the `n` meetings.
* Try to **compress** `k` meetings to create a window/gap of length at least `mid`.
* For each window, calculate how much shifting (adjustment) is needed to compress those meetings and create such a gap.
* If the number of required shifts is ‚â§ `k`, then it‚Äôs feasible.

#### 4. **Constraints Handling**

* Keep the relative order of meetings: this means we can only **push meetings later**, not rearrange their sequence.
* Meetings must stay within the `[0, eventTime]` interval and **not overlap** with neighbors.

---

### üí° Intuition

* Imagine pushing meetings **to the left** as tightly as possible. Any gaps will appear toward the **right**.
* By shifting a few carefully chosen meetings (up to `k`), we may cause some free interval to **merge**, resulting in a large continuous free time.
* The optimal strategy is to find **which `k` meetings to shift and how**, using binary search and greedy local decisions.

---

### üß† Summary

* **Optimize maximum free time** using **binary search**.
* In each check, **simulate** rescheduling within constraints.
* Use **greedy compression** of meeting times and maintain **relative order and non-overlapping** conditions.
* The result is the **maximum length** of a continuous free time achievable by shifting **up to `k` meetings**.
