### Example 1: Text Analysis in Linguistics
In linguistic research, analyzing the frequency and distribution of vowel-starting and vowel-ending words in different sections of a text can provide insights into language patterns and structures. For instance, a linguist might want to compare the usage of such words in different chapters of a book.

```javascript
const chapters = [
  "Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom.",
  "In this kingdom, lived a brave knight named Arthur.",
  "Arthur embarked on a quest to find the legendary sword.",
  "The sword was said to be hidden in a cave guarded by a dragon.",
  "After many trials, Arthur found the cave and defeated the dragon."
];

const queries = [
  [0, 1], // Analyze the first two chapters
  [2, 4], // Analyze the last three chapters
  [0, 4]  // Analyze the entire text
];

console.log(vowelStrings(chapters, queries)); // Output: [2, 3, 5]
```

### Example 2: Content Filtering in Social Media
A social media platform might want to filter and analyze posts that start and end with vowels to identify certain trends or patterns in user-generated content. For example, they might want to see how often such posts appear in different time ranges.

```javascript
const posts = [
  "Amazing experience at the concert!",
  "Enjoyed a wonderful dinner with friends.",
  "Had a great time hiking in the mountains.",
  "Unbelievable sunset at the beach.",
  "Excited for the upcoming vacation."
];

const timeRanges = [
  [0, 2], // Analyze posts from the first three time slots
  [1, 4], // Analyze posts from the second to the fifth time slots
  [0, 4]  // Analyze all posts
];

console.log(vowelStrings(posts, timeRanges)); // Output: [2, 3, 4]
```

In both examples, the `vowelStrings` function helps to efficiently count the number of words or posts that start and end with a vowel within specified ranges, providing valuable insights for analysis.
