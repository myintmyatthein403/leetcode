Let's break down the approach to solve this graph problem.

**Understanding the Problem**

The core task is to:

1.  **Identify Connected Components:**
    * We need to group vertices that are reachable from each other using the given edges.
2.  **Check for Completeness:**
    * For each identified connected component, we must determine if it's "complete." A component is complete if every pair of distinct vertices within that component has a direct edge connecting them.
3.  **Count Complete Components:**
    * Finally, we need to count how many of the identified connected components are complete.

**Approach**

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1.  **Build the Graph Representation:**
    * We'll use an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix to represent the graph. An adjacency list is often preferred for sparse graphs (graphs with relatively few edges) as it's more memory-efficient.

2.  **Identify Connected Components (Using Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search):**
    * We'll iterate through each vertex.
    * If a vertex hasn't been visited, we'll start a DFS or BFS traversal from that vertex.
    * During the traversal, we'll mark all reachable vertices as visited and add them to the current connected component.
    * We'll store each identified connected component as a list of vertices.

3.  **Check for Completeness of Each Component:**
    * For each identified connected component:
        * We'll iterate through all possible pairs of vertices within that component.
        * For each pair, we'll check if there's an edge between them in our graph representation.
        * If any pair of vertices doesn't have an edge, the component is not complete.
        * If all pairs of vertices do have an edge, the component is complete.

4.  **Count Complete Components:**
    * We'll maintain a count of complete components.
    * Whenever we find a complete component, we'll increment the count.

5.  **Return the Count:**
    * Return the final count of the complete connected components.

**Key Concepts**

* **Connected Components:** A subgraph where all vertices are reachable from each other.
* **Complete Graph (Clique):** A graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.
* **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Algorithms for traversing or searching graph data structures.
* **Adjacency List/Matrix:** Ways to represent graphs.

**In essence:**

1.  Find all the groups of connected nodes.
2.  For each group, verify if every node in that group is connected to every other node in that group.
3.  Count the groups where every node is connected to every other node.
