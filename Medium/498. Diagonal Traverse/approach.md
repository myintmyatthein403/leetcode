Great question 👍 Let’s break this problem down step by step.

We want to traverse a 2D matrix **diagonally** in a zig-zag pattern.

### 🔎 Key Observations

1. Every diagonal is defined by the **sum of its indices**:

   * For element `(i, j)`, the diagonal it belongs to is identified by `i + j`.
   * Example: in `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`,

     * `(0,0) → 0+0=0` (diagonal 0 → \[1])
     * `(0,1),(1,0) → sum=1` (diagonal 1 → \[2,4])
     * `(0,2),(1,1),(2,0) → sum=2` (diagonal 2 → \[3,5,7])

2. The direction alternates:

   * For even-numbered diagonals → traverse **upwards** (right to left in row terms).
   * For odd-numbered diagonals → traverse **downwards** (left to right).

3. Total diagonals = `m + n - 1`.

### ⚙️ Approach

1. **Iterate diagonals by their sum `d = i + j`.**

   * `d` ranges from `0` to `m + n - 2`.

2. **Collect elements belonging to the diagonal `d`:**

   * Row index can vary between `max(0, d - (n - 1))` and `min(m - 1, d)`.
   * Column index is then `j = d - i`.

3. **Apply direction rule:**

   * If `d` is even → reverse order before adding to result.
   * If `d` is odd → keep as is.

4. Append the collected diagonal to the result list.

### ✅ Example Walkthrough

For `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`:

* `d = 0 → [1]` → even → \[1]
* `d = 1 → [2,4]` → odd → \[2,4]
* `d = 2 → [3,5,7]` → even → reversed → \[7,5,3]
* `d = 3 → [6,8]` → odd → \[6,8]
* `d = 4 → [9]` → even → \[9]

Final → `[1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]`.

### 📊 Complexity

* **Time:** `O(m * n)` (every element visited once).
* **Space:** `O(1)` extra (excluding output).

👉 This approach works efficiently even for large matrices (`10^4` elements).
