To solve **[3085. Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special/)**, let’s first understand what a **k-special** string means:

> A string is **k-special** if for **any pair** of characters `i` and `j`, the absolute difference of their frequencies is **less than or equal to `k`**.

---

### 🔍 Problem Breakdown

Given a string `word`, we want to **minimize the number of deletions** needed so that all characters left satisfy:

```
|freq(c1) - freq(c2)| <= k for all characters c1 and c2
```

---

### ✅ Key Observations

1. **Frequency Map**:
   Count how many times each character appears.

2. **We want to equalize frequencies** as much as possible (within the `k` difference range). That means:

   * Either reduce high-frequency characters to match lower ones
   * Or eliminate low-frequency characters that are too far from the highest.

3. **Target Frequency Range**:
   Try to **fix a target frequency `f`**, and try to bring all characters within `[f, f+k]` (inclusive) via deletion.

4. **Multiple Targets**:
   Since we don't know which `f` gives the minimum deletions, we can **try all possible target frequencies** present in the string (or from 1 up to max frequency) and compute deletions needed.

---

### 🔄 Strategy / Algorithm

1. **Build frequency count** of all characters.
2. For each possible target frequency `f` from `1` to `max(freq)`:

   * For each character:

     * If its frequency is **less than `f`**, delete all occurrences (can’t reach target).
     * If frequency is **within `[f, f+k]`**, keep it.
     * If frequency is **greater than `f+k`**, delete the excess (`freq - (f+k)`).
   * Sum up all deletions.
3. Track the **minimum** total deletions over all possible target frequencies.

---

### 🧠 Why It Works

We want to preserve a "frequency band" of width `k` and eliminate all characters outside it. Trying all candidate bands (starting from `f`) ensures we consider all possible optimal ranges.

---

### 🧪 Time Complexity

* Building frequency map: **O(n)** where n is the string length.
* Trying each frequency `f` from 1 to max frequency (≤ n): **O(n²)** in worst-case, but can be optimized using sorting and prefix sums (for real implementation).

---

### 📦 Summary

To make the string k-special:

* Compute character frequencies.
* For each potential frequency `f`:

  * Make all character frequencies fall within `[f, f + k]` by deleting too-small or too-large ones.
* Track the minimum total deletions.

This approach finds the **minimum deletions** required to bring all character frequencies within a `k`-bounded range.
