To solve **Leetcode 3443. Maximum Manhattan Distance After K Changes**, we need to find the **maximum Manhattan distance from the origin** that can be achieved **at any time** during the walk, **after modifying at most `k` characters in the movement string `s`**.

### üîç **Understanding the Problem**

* You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on an infinite grid.
* Each character in the string moves you one unit in a direction.
* You can change **up to `k`** of these instructions into **any** other direction.
* You must process the string **in order**, but you can **strategically choose** up to `k` instructions to modify.
* **Goal:** Find the maximum Manhattan distance from the origin **during** this walk.

### üí° **Key Observations**

* **Manhattan Distance** at point `(x, y)` is `|x| + |y|`.
* The maximum distance doesn't necessarily occur at the end ‚Äî it could be at **any** intermediate point.
* We can **greedily modify** directions to maximize the distance.
* But since we must walk in order, we can‚Äôt rearrange steps, only **change them**.

### üß† **Approach Overview**

We will use a **greedy + priority strategy** while walking the path step by step:

#### Step 1: Simulate the Walk Without Any Changes

* Traverse the path `s` from start to finish.
* Keep track of position `(x, y)` at each step.
* Track the **Manhattan distance** at each step.

#### Step 2: Identify the Potential for Gain

* At each step, we calculate the **current distance** from the origin.
* Also, for each move (e.g. `'S'` at step `i`), consider:

  * What would have happened if we changed it to a **direction that increases distance** (like `'N'` or `'E'` if we're heading away from the origin)?
  * The **gain** is the difference between the new and old distance at that point.
* So, for each move, we can compute the **potential gain** in Manhattan distance if we changed it to the best possible direction.

#### Step 3: Greedily Apply the Best K Changes

* Store all potential gains in a **priority queue or sorted list**.
* Pick the **top `k` gains** and apply them.
* Resimulate the walk with these best changes applied.

#### Step 4: Track the Maximum Distance

* While simulating (after applying changes), keep updating the **maximum distance reached**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases

* If `k = 0`, we simply simulate the walk and return the maximum distance reached.
* If all directions are the same (e.g., `"NNNN"`), changing directions may **reduce** distance unless used smartly.

### ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n + n log k)`

  * One pass to simulate and compute gains.
  * Sorting or priority queue operations for top `k` gains.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing gains and simulation data.
