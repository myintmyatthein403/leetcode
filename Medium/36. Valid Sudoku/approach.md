Great question! Let’s carefully think about **how to approach the "Valid Sudoku" problem** step by step, without jumping into code.

### 🔑 Key Idea

We need to check **three constraints** on the board:

1. **Rows** → No duplicate digits in each row.
2. **Columns** → No duplicate digits in each column.
3. **3×3 Sub-boxes** → No duplicate digits inside each 3×3 block.

If all three conditions hold, the board is valid.

### ⚡ Step-by-Step Approach

#### 1. **Check rows**

* Traverse row by row.
* For each row, keep a record of digits we’ve seen (e.g., in a set).
* If a digit appears again → board is invalid.

#### 2. **Check columns**

* Traverse column by column.
* Same idea: keep track of digits seen in that column.
* If a duplicate is found → invalid.

#### 3. **Check 3×3 sub-boxes**

* The board has 9 sub-boxes, each of size 3×3:

  * Top-left sub-box: rows 0–2, cols 0–2
  * Next: rows 0–2, cols 3–5, … and so on.
* We can identify a sub-box by:

  ```
  subBoxIndex = (row // 3, col // 3)
  ```
* For each sub-box, track digits we’ve seen.
* If duplicate → invalid.

#### 4. **Ignore empty cells**

* If a cell contains `"."`, skip it — it does not affect validity.

### ⚙️ Example Walkthrough (valid case)

Input (first example):

```
Row 0: ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
```

* Check row → {5, 3, 7}, no duplicates.
* For col checks → update sets column-wise.
* For sub-box (0,0) → {5, 3}.
  All rules respected.

Continue through the board — since no duplication is found, it is valid.

### ⚠️ Invalid Example (second case)

First number is changed from **5 → 8**.

* Now in sub-box (0,0), we already have another **8**.
* Conflict found → return false immediately.

---

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

* We scan each cell **once** (9×9 = 81 cells).
* For each cell, we check/update row, column, and sub-box records.
* **Time complexity:** O(81) ≈ O(1) (constant, since board size is fixed).
* **Space complexity:** O(1) (we just store up to 81 digits in sets).

---

✅ **Summary**:

* Use sets to track numbers in **rows, columns, and sub-boxes**.
* Ignore `"."`.
* If a duplicate is found in any rule → return false.
* If no conflict → return true.
