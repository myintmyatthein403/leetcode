Here are two real-world examples where the concept of making a lexicographically smallest array by swapping elements within a limit can be applied:

### 1. Optimizing Task Scheduling
In a task scheduling system, tasks are represented by their priorities, and you want to reorder the tasks to minimize the overall priority list lexicographically. However, due to dependencies or constraints, you can only swap tasks if their priority difference is within a certain limit.

**Example:**
- **Tasks:** [5, 100, 44, 45, 16, 30, 14, 65, 83, 64]
- **Limit:** 15

By applying the algorithm, you can reorder the tasks to [5, 100, 14, 16, 30, 44, 45, 64, 83, 65], ensuring that the task list is optimized while respecting the constraints.

### 2. Reordering Inventory Items
In an inventory management system, items are sorted by their stock levels, and you want to reorder the items to minimize the stock levels lexicographically. However, due to storage constraints or handling limitations, you can only swap items if their stock level difference is within a certain limit.

**Example:**
- **Stock Levels:** [5, 100, 44, 45, 16, 30, 14, 65, 83, 64]
- **Limit:** 15

By applying the algorithm, you can reorder the stock levels to [5, 100, 14, 16, 30, 44, 45, 64, 83, 65], ensuring that the inventory is optimized while respecting the constraints.

In both examples, the goal is to achieve a lexicographically smallest order while adhering to specific constraints, which is a common requirement in various optimization problems.
