To help visualize the solution, let's break it down step by step with an example. I'll guide you through each stage and provide a clear explanation of how the groups are formed and how the result is obtained.

### Example Input:
```javascript
nums = [1, 7, 6, 18, 2, 1];
limit = 3;
```

### Step 1: **Sorting the Array**

We first sort the input array to get the lexicographically smallest order:

```javascript
numsSorted = [1, 1, 2, 6, 7, 18];
```

### Step 2: **Assigning Groups**

We then assign each element to a group, based on the `limit`. Two consecutive elements can belong to the same group if their difference is within the `limit`. If their difference exceeds the `limit`, a new group is created.

1. Start with the first element, `1`. It belongs to `Group 0`. 
   
   ```javascript
   numToGroup = { 1: 0 };
   groupToList = { 0: [1] };
   ```

2. The next element is `1`. Its difference with the previous `1` is `0`, which is less than or equal to the `limit`. So, it remains in `Group 0`.

   ```javascript
   numToGroup = { 1: 0, 1: 0 };
   groupToList = { 0: [1, 1] };
   ```

3. The next element is `2`. The difference with `1` is `1`, which is within the `limit`. So, it stays in `Group 0`.

   ```javascript
   numToGroup = { 1: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0 };
   groupToList = { 0: [1, 1, 2] };
   ```

4. The next element is `6`. The difference with `2` is `4`, which is greater than the `limit`. So, a new group is formed for `6`.

   ```javascript
   numToGroup = { 1: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 6: 1 };
   groupToList = { 0: [1, 1, 2], 1: [6] };
   ```

5. The next element is `7`. The difference with `6` is `1`, which is within the `limit`. So, it stays in `Group 1`.

   ```javascript
   numToGroup = { 1: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 6: 1, 7: 1 };
   groupToList = { 0: [1, 1, 2], 1: [6, 7] };
   ```

6. The last element is `18`. The difference with `7` is `11`, which is greater than the `limit`. So, a new group is formed for `18`.

   ```javascript
   numToGroup = { 1: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 6: 1, 7: 1, 18: 2 };
   groupToList = { 0: [1, 1, 2], 1: [6, 7], 2: [18] };
   ```

At the end of this step, we have three groups:

```javascript
groupToList = {
  0: [1, 1, 2],
  1: [6, 7],
  2: [18]
};
```

### Step 3: **Rebuilding the Array**

Now that we have sorted the elements into groups, we need to rebuild the original array, replacing each element with the lexicographically smallest element from its corresponding group.

1. The first element in `nums` is `1`. From `groupToList`, we take the first element from `Group 0` (which is `1`), and remove it from the group.

   ```javascript
   nums[0] = 1;  // First element in Group 0
   groupToList[0] = [1, 2];  // Updated Group 0
   ```

2. The next element in `nums` is `7`. From `groupToList`, we take the first element from `Group 1` (which is `6`), and remove it from the group.

   ```javascript
   nums[1] = 6;  // First element in Group 1
   groupToList[1] = [7];  // Updated Group 1
   ```

3. The next element in `nums` is `6`. From `groupToList`, we take the first element from `Group 1` (which is `7`), and remove it from the group.

   ```javascript
   nums[2] = 7;  // First element in Group 1
   groupToList[1] = [];  // Updated Group 1
   ```

4. The next element in `nums` is `18`. From `groupToList`, we take the first element from `Group 2` (which is `18`), and remove it from the group.

   ```javascript
   nums[3] = 18;  // First element in Group 2
   groupToList[2] = [];  // Updated Group 2
   ```

5. The next element in `nums` is `2`. From `groupToList`, we take the first element from `Group 0` (which is `2`), and remove it from the group.

   ```javascript
   nums[4] = 2;  // First element in Group 0
   groupToList[0] = [1];  // Updated Group 0
   ```

6. The final element in `nums` is `1`. From `groupToList`, we take the first element from `Group 0` (which is `1`), and remove it from the group.

   ```javascript
   nums[5] = 1;  // First element in Group 0
   groupToList[0] = [];  // Updated Group 0
   ```

### Final Output:

At the end of the process, the `nums` array is rebuilt as:

```javascript
nums = [1, 6, 7, 18, 2, 1];
```

This is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain using the `limit` condition.

### Summary:

- **Step 1**: Sort the `nums` array.
- **Step 2**: Assign groups based on the difference between consecutive elements, ensuring the difference is less than or equal to the `limit`.
- **Step 3**: Rebuild the original array using the lexicographically smallest element from each group.

This approach ensures that we get the lexicographically smallest array while respecting the limit on the differences between swappable elements.
