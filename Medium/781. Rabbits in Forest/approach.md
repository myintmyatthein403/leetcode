This problem is a classic case of using a **greedy counting strategy** and is related to the idea of grouping elements based on their constraints. Let’s walk through the approach and logic step-by-step:

### 🧠 **Understanding the Question**

Each rabbit answers, “There are **x** other rabbits with the same color as me.”  
That implies **x + 1** rabbits total (including itself) share that color.

The twist: **we don’t know if two rabbits with the same answer are actually of the same color.**

So, we must find the **minimum number** of total rabbits in the forest that **satisfies all the given answers**.

---

### 💡 **Key Observations**

- If multiple rabbits give the same answer `x`, we can group them into sets of size `x + 1`.
- But **we can only group at most `x + 1` rabbits** together per color group.
- So, if more than `x + 1` rabbits give answer `x`, we need to form **multiple groups** of that size.

---

### 📊 **Strategy**

1. **Count frequency** of each answer using a hashmap.
2. For each unique answer `x` with frequency `freq`:
   - Each group can have up to `x + 1` rabbits.
   - So, the number of groups needed is `ceil(freq / (x + 1))`.
   - Each group contributes `x + 1` rabbits to the total count.
3. **Sum up the total rabbits** across all groups to get the minimum possible number.

### ✅ **Why This Works**

This approach **guarantees consistency** (each group size matches the rabbit’s statement) while ensuring we **don't overestimate** the total rabbit count by unnecessarily assuming more color groups than needed.
