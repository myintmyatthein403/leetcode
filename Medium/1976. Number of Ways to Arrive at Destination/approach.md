Let's break down the approach to solve this problem.

**Understanding the Problem**

The core of the problem is finding the number of shortest paths from a source node (intersection 0) to a destination node (intersection n-1) in a weighted, undirected graph. This combines two classic graph algorithms:

1.  **Shortest Path Finding:** We need to determine the shortest distance from the source to the destination.
2.  **Path Counting:** We need to count how many distinct paths achieve that shortest distance.

**Approach**

1.  **Graph Representation:**
    * Represent the city as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix. Since the roads are bi-directional, each edge `(u, v, time)` should be added to the adjacency list/matrix for both `u` and `v`.

2.  **Shortest Path Calculation (Dijkstra's Algorithm):**
    * Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest distances from the source node (0) to all other nodes.
    * Modify Dijkstra's algorithm to also track the number of shortest paths found so far.
    * Initialize `dist[0] = 0` (distance from source to itself is 0) and `ways[0] = 1` (there's one way to reach the source).
    * For all other nodes, initialize `dist[i] = infinity` and `ways[i] = 0`.
    * Use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently select the node with the smallest distance.
    * When processing a neighbor `v` of the current node `u`:
        * If `dist[u] + time(u, v) < dist[v]`, it means we've found a shorter path to `v`. Update `dist[v]` and set `ways[v] = ways[u]`.
        * if `dist[u] + time(u,v) == dist[v]`, then we have found another path of the same shortest distance, so we must add the number of ways we arrived at u, to the number of ways we arrived at v. i.e. `ways[v] += ways[u]`.

3.  **Result:**
    * After Dijkstra's algorithm completes, `ways[n-1]` will contain the number of shortest paths from the source to the destination.
    * Return `ways[n-1]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Key Considerations**

* **Modulo Operation:** Apply the modulo operation (`% (10^9 + 7)`) after each addition to prevent integer overflow.
* **Priority Queue:** A priority queue is crucial for the efficiency of Dijkstra's algorithm, as it allows us to quickly retrieve the node with the smallest distance.
* **Handling Equal Distances:** The key to counting the number of shortest paths is correctly handling cases where multiple paths lead to the same node with the same shortest distance.

**In essence, you're running a modified Dijkstra's algorithm that not only tracks the shortest distances but also the number of ways to reach each node along those shortest paths.**
