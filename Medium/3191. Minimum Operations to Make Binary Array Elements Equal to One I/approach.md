**Understanding the Problem**

The core challenge is to transform a binary array (`nums`) into an array where all elements are 1, using only a specific flipping operation. This operation flips three consecutive elements at a time. We need to find the *minimum* number of these operations.

**Key Observations and Strategy**

1.  **Focus on Leading Zeros:** The most efficient way to tackle this problem is to focus on eliminating leading zeros from the left. If you encounter a zero, you *must* perform a flip operation starting at that index.

2.  **Greedy Approach:** A greedy strategy is optimal here. If you see a zero, flip the three consecutive elements starting at that zero. This ensures you address the zero immediately and potentially affect subsequent elements in a beneficial way.

3.  **Propagation of Changes:** Each flip impacts three consecutive elements. This means the effects of a flip propagate forward and need to be considered when processing subsequent elements.

4.  **Checking for Infeasibility:** After processing the array, you need to verify if all elements are indeed 1. If any zeros remain, it's impossible to achieve the desired outcome, and you should return -1.

**Step-by-Step Approach**

1.  **Initialization:**
    * Start with a counter (`operations`) to track the number of flips. Initialize it to 0.

2.  **Iterate through the Array:**
    * Traverse the `nums` array from left to right.
    * For each element `nums[i]`:
        * If `nums[i]` is 0:
            * Increment `operations`.
            * Perform the flip operation on `nums[i]`, `nums[i+1]`, and `nums[i+2]`.
            * Note: Ensure that `i + 2` is within the bounds of the array. If not, the problem is impossible.
            * If the index i+2 is out of bounds, then it is impossible to make every element a 1.
        * If nums[i] is 1, continue to the next index.

3.  **Check for Remaining Zeros:**
    * After the iteration, check if any zeros remain in the `nums` array.
    * If any zeros are found, return -1 (indicating impossibility).

4.  **Return the Result:**
    * If no zeros remain, return the value of `operations`.

**Example Walkthrough (nums = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0])**

1.  * `i = 0`, `nums[0] = 0`. Flip `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, `nums[2]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`. `operations = 1`.
2.  * `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 0`. Flip `nums[1]`, `nums[2]`, `nums[3]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`. `operations = 2`.
3.  * `i = 3`, `nums[3] = 0`. Flip `nums[3]`, `nums[4]`, `nums[5]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. `operations = 3`.
4.  * All elements are 1. Return `operations = 3`.

**Example Walkthrough (nums = [0, 1, 1, 1])**

1.  * `i = 0`, `nums[0] = 0`. Flip `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, `nums[2]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 0, 0, 1]`. `operations = 1`.
2.  * `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 0`. Flip `nums[1]`, `nums[2]`, `nums[3]`. `nums` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 0]`. `operations = 2`.
3.  * `i = 3`, `nums[3] = 0`. i+2 would be out of bounds. Return -1.
