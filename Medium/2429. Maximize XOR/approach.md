To solve the problem of finding the integer `x` such that `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2` and `x XOR num1` is minimal, you can follow these steps:

1. **Count Set Bits in `num2`:** Determine the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `num2`.

2. **Generate Candidate `x`:** Start with `x` as 0. Iterate through the bits of `num1` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If the current bit of `num1` is 0 and you still need more set bits to match `num2`, set the corresponding bit in `x` to 1.

3. **Adjust Remaining Bits:** If there are still set bits needed after processing all bits of `num1`, set the remaining bits in `x` starting from the least significant bit until the required number of set bits is reached.

Here is a Python function implementing this approach:

```python
def minimize_xor(num1, num2):
    # Count the number of set bits in num2
    set_bits_num2 = bin(num2).count('1')
    
    # Initialize x to 0
    x = 0
    
    # Iterate through the bits of num1
    for i in range(31, -1, -1):
        if num1 & (1 << i):
            if set_bits_num2 > 0:
                x |= (1 << i)
                set_bits_num2 -= 1
    
    # If there are still set bits needed, set the remaining bits in x
    for i in range(32):
        if set_bits_num2 > 0 and not (x & (1 << i)):
            x |= (1 << i)
            set_bits_num2 -= 1
    
    return x
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** Count the number of set bits in `num2` using `bin(num2).count('1')`.
- **Step 2:** Initialize `x` to 0 and iterate through the bits of `num1` from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. If the current bit of `num1` is 1 and you still need more set bits to match `num2`, set the corresponding bit in `x` to 1.
- **Step 3:** If there are still set bits needed after processing all bits of `num1`, set the remaining bits in `x` starting from the least significant bit until the required number of set bits is reached.

This approach ensures that `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2` and `x XOR num1` is minimal.
