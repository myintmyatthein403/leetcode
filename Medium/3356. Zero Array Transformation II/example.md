This problem models situations where we need to **gradually reduce values within specific constraints** until they reach zero. Here are two real-world scenarios where this logic can be applied:

---

### **1. Managing Server Load with Rate-Limiting Requests**
#### **Scenario:**
- A cloud provider manages a set of servers (`nums`), each with an initial CPU load.
- Incoming **rate-limiting policies** (`queries`) can **reduce** CPU load in specific time windows but only up to a limit (`vali`).
- The goal is to find the minimum number of rate-limit enforcement rules needed to bring all servers to **idle (zero load).**

#### **How the Model Fits:**
- `nums[i]` represents the initial load on the `i-th` server.
- `queries[i] = [li, ri, vali]` means applying a rate-limiting policy to reduce load in the range `[li, ri]` by at most `vali` per step.
- The task is to determine the minimum number of rate-limiting actions required to bring all server loads to zero.

### **2. Inventory Clearance with Discount Campaigns**
#### **Scenario:**
- A company has different warehouses, each storing a certain amount of stock (`nums`).
- They run **discount campaigns** (`queries`), which reduce stock levels in selected warehouses but only up to a certain maximum reduction per campaign.
- The objective is to determine the minimum number of campaigns needed to completely **clear out** all inventory.

#### **How the Model Fits:**
- `nums[i]` represents the initial stock in the `i-th` warehouse.
- `queries[i] = [li, ri, vali]` represents a discount campaign affecting stock in warehouses `[li, ri]`, reducing up to `vali`.
- The goal is to find the **minimum number of campaigns** required to deplete all stock.

### **Why This Approach Works in Real-World Cases?**
- **Incremental Reductions:** Many real-world processes involve gradual adjustments rather than instant changes.
- **Independent Reductions:** Different elements (servers, warehouses, etc.) may reduce at different rates, just like our problem allows.
- **Optimization for Minimum Steps:** In both cases, businesses or systems benefit from achieving the goal in the **fewest steps possible**.
