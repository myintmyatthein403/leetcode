### **Approach: Greedy with Range Constraints**

We need to determine the minimum number of queries needed to turn the given `nums` array into a **Zero Array**. The key challenge is that each query allows us to decrement values in a given range `[li, ri]` independently, but by at most `vali`.

---

### **Observations**
1. **Each element must reach zero independently**  
   - For every `nums[i]`, we need enough queries covering index `i` to allow reducing it to `0`.
   
2. **Queries are applied in sequence**  
   - This means we can only utilize the first `k` queries. If some index still has a nonzero value after `k` queries, then `k` is not sufficient.

3. **Greedy Reduction Strategy**  
   - Since each query allows independent decrements at each index, we should try to reduce each `nums[i]` as efficiently as possible using the first `k` queries.

---

### **Algorithm**
1. **Iterate over queries one by one**  
   - Track how much each index can be decremented at every step.

2. **Use a Difference Array for Efficient Range Updates**  
   - Instead of updating `nums` directly (which would be inefficient), use a **difference array** to efficiently keep track of decrement operations.

3. **Apply Queries and Check if `nums` Reaches Zero**  
   - After applying the first `k` queries, check if every element in `nums` has been reduced to `0`.

4. **Find the Minimum `k` Using Binary Search**  
   - Instead of checking every `k` sequentially, use **binary search** on `k` (from `1` to `m`, where `m` is the number of queries) to find the minimum valid `k`.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Using a Difference Array:**  
  - Query application is **O(1)** per query using range updates.
  - Constructing `nums` from the difference array takes **O(n)**.
- **Binary Search on `k`:**  
  - We perform at most **O(log m)** iterations.
  - Each iteration requires checking if `nums` can be zeroed out, which is **O(n + m)**.
- **Overall Complexity:**  
  - **O((n + m) log m)**, which is efficient given large `n` and `m`.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Use a **difference array** to efficiently apply range updates.
- Use **binary search on `k`** to quickly find the smallest valid number of queries.
- Iterate efficiently and avoid brute force by leveraging structured range updates.
