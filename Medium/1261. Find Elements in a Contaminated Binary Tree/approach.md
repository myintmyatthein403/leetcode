### **Approach to Solve the Problem**

The problem involves reconstructing a binary tree based on the given rules and efficiently searching for elements in it.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Structure of the Tree**
The tree follows a strict structure based on the given formulas:
- Root node always has `val = 0`.
- If a node has `val = x`:
  - Its left child (if present) has `val = 2 * x + 1`
  - Its right child (if present) has `val = 2 * x + 2`
  
Given this, the tree follows a **complete binary tree-like structure**, and the values of each node can be **uniquely determined** without ambiguity.

---

### **Step 2: Recovering the Tree**
Since the tree is contaminated (all values set to `-1`), we need to **restore** it by performing a **Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS)** starting from the root:
1. Set `root.val = 0`
2. Traverse the tree:
   - If visiting a node with value `x`, update:
     - `left child (if exists) → val = 2 * x + 1`
     - `right child (if exists) → val = 2 * x + 2`
3. Store all recovered values in a **hash set (`unordered_set<int>`)** for quick lookups.

---

### **Step 3: Efficient Searching with Hash Set**
Once the tree is recovered, the `find(target)` function should **efficiently check if the target value exists**.

Since the tree structure is deterministic:
- Instead of traversing the tree for every search, we store all values in a **hash set** (O(1) average time complexity for lookups).
- When `find(target)` is called, we simply check if `target` exists in the set.

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
1. **Tree Recovery:**
   - Since we traverse every node once, it takes **O(n)** time.
2. **Finding a Value:**
   - Since we use a **hash set**, lookup takes **O(1)** time on average.

Thus, the total operations are:
- **O(n)** for tree recovery (one-time preprocessing).
- **O(1)** for each `find(target)` query.

---

### **Space Complexity**
1. **Tree Storage:** If we use a set to store node values, it takes **O(n)** space.
2. **Tree Reconstruction:** Uses recursive DFS or iterative BFS, which takes **O(n)** in the worst case.

---

### **Final Summary**
- **Recover the tree** using DFS/BFS and store values in a hash set.
- **Use a hash set** for fast lookups (`O(1)`) in `find(target)`.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) for recovery, O(1) per find operation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing recovered values.

This approach ensures **fast and efficient** operations.
