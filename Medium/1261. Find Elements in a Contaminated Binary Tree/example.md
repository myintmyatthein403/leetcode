Here are two real-world use cases where this problem's solution can be applied:

### **1. Recovering Corrupted Data in Binary Trees (Faulty Memory Systems)**
**Scenario:**  
Imagine a system that stores hierarchical data structures (such as files in a filesystem, hierarchical configurations, or decision trees for AI). Due to corruption (e.g., software bugs, hardware faults, or malicious attacks), the values in the tree get reset or changed to an invalid default value (like `-1`).  

**Application:**  
- The **FindElements** class can help **restore** the original structure of the tree based on known deterministic relationships (like `2 * x + 1` for left and `2 * x + 2` for right).  
- After recovery, **quick lookups** using the `find()` function allow the system to efficiently check whether a particular element exists.  

**Example Use Case:**  
- A **filesystem recovery tool** could use this method to reconstruct corrupted directory structures.  
- A **distributed database with tree-based indexing (like B-Trees or Binary Search Trees)** could use a similar approach for crash recovery.

### **2. Verifying Hierarchical User Permissions in a System**
**Scenario:**  
In a **role-based access control (RBAC) system**, permissions and roles are often stored in a tree structure. Each role is assigned a numeric ID based on a well-defined hierarchy. However, if the system experiences a bug or cyberattack that corrupts stored IDs, they may be reset to an invalid default.  

**Application:**  
- The **FindElements** class could be used to **rebuild** the correct role hierarchy.
- After rebuilding, the `find()` method allows the system to **quickly check** whether a particular role exists.  

**Example Use Case:**  
- **Enterprise software** where managers and employees have role-based permissions in an organization.  
- **Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management)** services could use this approach to recover corrupted access control trees.

### **Why This Approach Works in These Cases**
1. **Deterministic Recovery** â†’ The tree values follow a known pattern, making it possible to reconstruct them even if they are lost.  
2. **Fast Lookups** â†’ The use of a `Set` ensures quick `O(1)` retrieval, making the system efficient.  
3. **Scalability** â†’ Works well even with large hierarchical structures, such as filesystems or permission trees.
