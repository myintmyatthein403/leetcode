Got it â€” letâ€™s reason it out step by step (no code, just approach + explanation).

---

### ðŸ”Ž Step 1: Understand the rules

* There are **two piles of flowers** (lane 1 = `x`, lane 2 = `y`).
* Players alternate removing **exactly one flower** from either pile.
* Alice always goes first.
* Whoever removes the **last flower overall** wins.

So this is essentially a **two-pile game** where each move reduces one of the piles by 1.

---

### ðŸ”Ž Step 2: Compare with classic Nim

This looks like a simplified **Nim** game:

* Normally, Nim allows removing *any number* of stones from a pile.
* Here, only **1 stone per move** is allowed.

That means the game is just a matter of **total parity** (sum of flowers).

* If the total `x + y` is **odd**, then Alice (the first player) will always win, because the game lasts `x+y` moves, and odd number of moves means Alice makes the last move.
* If the total `x + y` is **even**, Bob wins, because he gets the last move.

---

### ðŸ”Ž Step 3: Condition for Alice winning

Alice wins **iff**:

$$
x + y \; \text{is odd}
$$

That means one pile must be **odd**, and the other must be **even**.

---

### ðŸ”Ž Step 4: Counting valid pairs `(x, y)`

We need to count pairs `(x, y)` such that:

* `1 â‰¤ x â‰¤ n`
* `1 â‰¤ y â‰¤ m`
* `x + y` is odd.

That means:

* Case 1: `x` is odd, `y` is even.
* Case 2: `x` is even, `y` is odd.

So the number of winning pairs =

$$
(\#\text{odds in } [1,n]) \times (\#\text{evens in } [1,m]) + (\#\text{evens in } [1,n]) \times (\#\text{odds in } [1,m])
$$

---

### ðŸ”Ž Step 5: Compute counts of odds/evens

For a range `[1, k]`:

* Number of odds = $\lceil k/2 \rceil$
* Number of evens = $\lfloor k/2 \rfloor$

So:

* Odds in `n`: `(n + 1) // 2`
* Evens in `n`: `n // 2`
* Odds in `m`: `(m + 1) // 2`
* Evens in `m`: `m // 2`

---

### ðŸ”Ž Step 6: Final formula

$$
\text{Answer} = \Big(\frac{n+1}{2}\Big) \cdot \Big(\frac{m}{2}\Big) \;+\; \Big(\frac{n}{2}\Big) \cdot \Big(\frac{m+1}{2}\Big)
$$

---

âœ… **Check Example 1:**

* n=3, m=2
* Odds in n=2, Evens in n=1
* Odds in m=1, Evens in m=1
* Answer = (2*1) + (1*1) = 3 â†’ âœ…

âœ… **Check Example 2:**

* n=1, m=1
* Odds in n=1, Evens in n=0
* Odds in m=1, Evens in m=0
* Answer = (1*0) + (0*1) = 0 â†’ âœ…

---

ðŸ‘‰ So the whole game reduces to **parity checking** and counting odd/even numbers in ranges.
