To solve **Leetcode 3440: Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time II**, we aim to **maximize the longest continuous free time** in a time window $0, `eventTime`$, by **rescheduling at most one meeting** (preserving its duration) **without overlaps**.

---

### üîç **Problem Understanding**

* You‚Äôre given `n` **non-overlapping meetings**, each as `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]`.
* You can **move one meeting** to a different slot (within bounds and still non-overlapping).
* Goal: **Maximize the longest free period** between meetings after **at most one reschedule**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Key Observations**

1. **Free time gaps** are the periods between adjacent meetings:

   ```
   gap[i] = startTime[i] - endTime[i - 1]
   ```
2. **Initial free time** is calculated based on the current meeting schedule.
3. Rescheduling one meeting might:

   * **Insert a bigger gap** in some location.
   * **Shift the meeting to a less disruptive spot**, increasing one of the free gaps.
   * **Free up a large continuous period**.

### üß† **Approach Strategy**

1. **Calculate Current Free Times**

   * Collect all gaps between adjacent meetings.
   * Track the **maximum gap** before any rescheduling.

2. **Try Rescheduling Each Meeting**

   * For each meeting:

     * Compute its **duration**.
     * Try moving it **to all possible gaps** where it fits:

       * Between existing meetings.
       * At the beginning (`0`) or end (`eventTime`).
     * Simulate the new set of meetings with this one moved.
     * Recalculate the new gaps after the move.
     * Update the **maximum free time** found.

3. **Efficient Strategy (Instead of trying all combinations)**

   * Since meetings are sorted and non-overlapping, and we can only move one:

     * **Precompute prefix and suffix free time info** (left and right of each meeting).
     * For each meeting, try removing it:

       * Reconstruct the free time gaps without that meeting.
       * Try reinserting it elsewhere (beginning, middle gaps, or end) where it fits.
     * Use a **sliding window** or greedy approach to find best insertion spot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Complexity Considerations**

* Brute-force movement of each meeting to every other gap would be `O(n¬≤)` ‚Äî too slow for `n = 10‚Åµ`.
* Optimal approach:

  * **Precompute** all gap ranges: `O(n)`
  * **Try removing one meeting** and inserting into optimal new location: `O(n log n)` or better with prefix/suffix structures.

---

### üì¶ Summary

* Compute all existing free time gaps.
* For each meeting:

  * Remove it, freeing up two gaps.
  * Try to reinsert into one of the existing gaps where it fits.
  * After reinserting, check new maximum gap.
* Return the **maximum free time** achieved by any such move (or no move).

This is essentially a **greedy + simulation** problem with a performance constraint, so we must avoid brute-force rescheduling and instead **strategically choose the best gap to reuse**.
