1. **Initialize Result Array**:
   - Create an empty array `result` to store the number of operations required for each box.

2. **Iterate Through Each Box**:
   - Use a loop to iterate through each box (indexed by `i`).

3. **Calculate Moves for Each Box**:
   - For each box `i`, initialize a counter `count` to zero.
   - Use another loop to iterate through all boxes (indexed by `j`).
   - If a box `j` contains a ball (`boxes[j] === "1"`), calculate the distance between box `i` and box `j` using `Math.abs(i - j)` and add this distance to `count`.

4. **Store the Result**:
   - After calculating the total moves for box `i`, push the `count` value to the `result` array.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the `result` array containing the number of operations for each box.

### Why This Approach Works:
- **Brute Force Method**: This approach uses a brute force method to calculate the number of moves for each box by considering the distance from every other box that contains a ball. Although it may not be the most efficient, it ensures that all possible moves are considered.
- **Simplicity**: The algorithm is straightforward and easy to understand, making it a good starting point for solving the problem.
- **Correctness**: By iterating through all boxes and calculating the distance for each ball, the approach guarantees that the minimum number of operations is accurately computed for each box.
