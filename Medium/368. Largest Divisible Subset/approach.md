Alright, let's break down this problem. We're looking to find the largest subset of a given set of distinct positive integers, where every pair of numbers in the subset must have a divisibility relationship (one number divides the other).

Here's the approach we'll take:

**1. Sorting:**

* First, we'll sort the input array `nums` in ascending order. This sorting step is crucial because it allows us to efficiently check divisibility. If a number `a` divides `b`, and `b` divides `c`, then `a` also divides `c`. Sorting helps us build our subset incrementally.

**2. Dynamic Programming:**

* We'll use dynamic programming to keep track of the largest subset ending at each number.
* We'll create two arrays:
    * `dp`: An array where `dp[i]` stores the size of the largest divisible subset ending at `nums[i]`.
    * `parent`: An array where `parent[i]` stores the index of the previous number in the largest divisible subset ending at `nums[i]`. This will help us reconstruct the subset later.
* We iterate through the sorted `nums` array. For each number `nums[i]`, we iterate through all the previous numbers `nums[j]` (where `j < i`).
* If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, we check if adding `nums[i]` to the subset ending at `nums[j]` creates a larger subset than the current largest subset ending at `nums[i]`. If it does, we update `dp[i]` and `parent[i]`.

**3. Finding the Largest Subset:**

* After the dynamic programming step, we find the index `maxIndex` with the largest value in the `dp` array. This index corresponds to the last number in the largest divisible subset.

**4. Reconstructing the Subset:**

* We use the `parent` array to backtrack from `nums[maxIndex]` and reconstruct the largest divisible subset.

**Explanation:**

* The sorting ensures that when we check for divisibility, we only need to consider numbers that came before the current number.
* The dynamic programming approach allows us to efficiently build the largest divisible subset by reusing the results of subproblems.
* The parent array allows us to reconstruct the largest subset.

This approach ensures that we find the largest subset that satisfies the given divisibility conditions.
