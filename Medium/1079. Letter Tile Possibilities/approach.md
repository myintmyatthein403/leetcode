The problem requires finding the number of distinct non-empty sequences that can be formed using the given tiles, where each tile has a letter printed on it.

### **Approach: Backtracking with Permutations and Duplicate Handling**
Since the order of letters matters, this is a permutation problem. However, because some letters may be repeated, we need to handle duplicates carefully to avoid counting the same sequence multiple times.

#### **1. Count the Frequency of Letters**
Since the order of letters matters but duplicates exist, we first count how many times each letter appears. This helps in generating unique permutations efficiently.

#### **2. Use Backtracking to Generate Sequences**
- Start with an empty sequence.
- Try adding each available letter to the sequence, ensuring we donâ€™t exceed its available count.
- After adding a letter, recursively explore further extensions of the sequence.
- Backtrack by removing the last added letter and trying the next available option.

#### **3. Avoid Duplicate Computation**
Since we keep track of the frequency of each letter, we avoid recomputing the same sequence multiple times.

#### **4. Base Case**
If all available letters have been used up, we stop the recursion.

#### **5. Count All Unique Sequences**
By tracking unique paths and counting them, we get the total number of distinct sequences.

### **Complexity Analysis**
The worst-case scenario occurs when all letters are unique, leading to \( O(n!) \) complexity. However, for cases with duplicate letters, the effective complexity is reduced significantly using frequency counting.
