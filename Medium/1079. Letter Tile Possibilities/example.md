Here are two **real-world applications** where this approach can be useful:

### **1. Word Generation in Puzzle Games (e.g., Scrabble, Boggle)**
   - In word puzzle games like **Scrabble** or **Boggle**, players form words using available letters.
   - This algorithm can help compute **all possible valid word sequences** that can be created using given letter tiles.
   - It could be extended to check against a dictionary to find valid words.

### **2. Password or CAPTCHA Strength Analysis**
   - When analyzing **password strength**, we often need to determine the number of unique combinations possible with given characters.
   - This algorithm can be used to estimate the **total possible sequences** a hacker would have to try in a brute-force attack.
   - For **CAPTCHAs**, it could be used to generate random letter sequences for security purposes.

Would you like an adaptation of the algorithm for one of these cases? ðŸš€
