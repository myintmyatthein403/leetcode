All right, let's break down the approach to solve this partition problem.

**Understanding the Problem**

The core challenge is to determine if an array can be split into two subsets with equal sums. This implies:

1.  **Total Sum:** The sum of all elements in the array must be even. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to create two subsets with equal sums.
2.  **Target Sum:** If the total sum is even, the target sum for each subset is half of the total sum.
3.  **Subset Sum Problem:** The problem then reduces to finding a subset of the array that sums up to the target sum.

**Approach**

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1.  **Calculate Total Sum:** Calculate the sum of all elements in the `nums` array.
2.  **Check for Odd Sum:** If the total sum is odd, return `false` immediately.
3.  **Calculate Target Sum:** If the total sum is even, calculate the target sum (half of the total sum).
4.  **Dynamic Programming Table:** Create a 2D boolean array (or matrix) `dp` with dimensions `(nums.length + 1) x (targetSum + 1)`.
    * `dp[i][j]` represents whether a subset of the first `i` elements can sum up to `j`.
5.  **Initialization:**
    * Initialize the first column of `dp` to `true` (an empty subset can always sum up to 0).
    * Initialize the first row of `dp` (except `dp[0][0]`) to `false` (no subset can sum up to a non-zero value with no elements).
6.  **Fill the DP Table:**
    * Iterate through the `dp` table, starting from `i = 1` and `j = 1`.
    * For each cell `dp[i][j]`:
        * If `j` (the target sum) is greater than or equal to `nums[i - 1]` (the current element), `dp[i][j]` is `true` if either:
            * `dp[i - 1][j]` is `true` (the subset without the current element can sum up to `j`).
            * `dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]]` is `true` (the subset with the current element can sum up to `j`).
        * Otherwise (if `j < nums[i - 1]`), `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` (the current element is too large to be included).
7.  **Return Result:**
    * The result is stored in `dp[nums.length][targetSum]`. Return this value.

**Explanation**

* The dynamic programming approach efficiently explores all possible subsets.
* The `dp` table stores intermediate results, avoiding redundant calculations.
* By iterating through the table, we determine if a subset with the target sum exists.

This approach provides a clear and efficient way to solve the partition problem.
