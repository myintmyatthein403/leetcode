The problem asks us to replace all zeros in two given arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, with strictly positive integers (meaning at least 1) such that the sum of elements in both arrays becomes equal. Our goal is to find the *minimum* possible equal sum, or return -1 if it's impossible.

Here's the approach to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate Minimum Possible Sums for Each Array:**

To achieve the *minimum* possible sum for an array, we should replace each zero with the smallest possible strictly positive integer, which is 1.

* **For `nums1`:**
    * Iterate through `nums1` to calculate `current_sum1`, which is the sum of all non-zero elements.
    * Count the number of zeros in `nums1`. Let this be `zero_count1`.
    * The minimum possible sum for `nums1` is `min_sum1 = current_sum1 + zero_count1 * 1`.

* **For `nums2`:**
    * Similarly, iterate through `nums2` to calculate `current_sum2`, the sum of all non-zero elements.
    * Count the number of zeros in `nums2`. Let this be `zero_count2`.
    * The minimum possible sum for `nums2` is `min_sum2 = current_sum2 + zero_count2 * 1`.

**2. Determine the Minimum Equal Sum or Impossibility:**

Now we have the `min_sum1` and `min_sum2`, which represent the smallest sums each array can achieve by replacing its zeros with 1s.

* **If `min_sum1` is less than `min_sum2`:**
    * We need to increase the sum of `nums1` to match `min_sum2`.
    * This is only possible if `nums1` has at least one zero (`zero_count1 > 0`). If `zero_count1` is 0, it means `nums1` has no zeros, and its sum is fixed at `current_sum1` (which is equal to `min_sum1`). Since `min_sum1` is already less than `min_sum2`, it's impossible to make them equal. In this case, return -1.
    * If `zero_count1 > 0`, we can increase `min_sum1` by replacing some of its zeros with values greater than 1 until its sum equals `min_sum2`. Therefore, the minimum equal sum will be `min_sum2`.

* **If `min_sum2` is less than `min_sum1`:**
    * This is symmetric to the previous case. We need to increase the sum of `nums2` to match `min_sum1`.
    * This is only possible if `nums2` has at least one zero (`zero_count2 > 0`). If `zero_count2` is 0, it's impossible, so return -1.
    * If `zero_count2 > 0`, we can increase `min_sum2` to match `min_sum1`. The minimum equal sum will be `min_sum1`.

* **If `min_sum1` is equal to `min_sum2`:**
    * The arrays can already achieve equal sums at their minimum possible values (by replacing all zeros with 1s). This is the minimum equal sum. Return `min_sum1` (or `min_sum2`).

**In summary:**

1.  Calculate `min_sum1 = (sum of non-zero elements in nums1) + (count of zeros in nums1)`.
2.  Calculate `min_sum2 = (sum of non-zero elements in nums2) + (count of zeros in nums2)`.
3.  If `min_sum1 < min_sum2` and `zero_count1` is 0, return -1.
4.  If `min_sum2 < min_sum1` and `zero_count2` is 0, return -1.
5.  Otherwise, the minimum equal sum is `max(min_sum1, min_sum2)`.
