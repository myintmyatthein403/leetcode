Let's break down how to approach this problem.

**Understanding the Problem**

The core challenge is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in a 2D grid equal, given that each operation involves adding or subtracting a fixed value `x`. If it's impossible to achieve a uni-value grid, we return -1.

**Key Observations and Approach**

1.  **Modulo Consistency:**
    * The key to determining if a uni-value grid is even possible lies in the modulo operation. If the difference between any two elements in the grid is not divisible by `x`, then it's impossible to make all elements equal.
    * This is because adding or subtracting `x` from any element will not change its remainder when divided by `x`. Therefore, all elements must have the same remainder when divided by `x`.
2.  **Finding the Target Value:**
    * If the modulo consistency check passes, we need to find the optimal target value to minimize the number of operations.
    * The median of the sorted grid elements is the optimal target value.
    * Why the median? Because the median minimizes the sum of absolute differences.
3.  **Calculating Operations:**
    * Once we have the target value (the median), we iterate through the grid and calculate the number of operations required to transform each element to the target.
    * The number of operations for each element is the absolute difference between the element and the median, divided by `x`.
4.  **Steps:**
    * **Check modulo consistency:** Iterate through the grid, and ensure that all grid elements have the same modulo x value. If they don't, return -1.
    * **Flatten and sort the grid:** Convert the 2D grid into a 1D array and sort it.
    * **Find the median:** Calculate the median of the sorted array.
    * **Calculate operations:** Iterate through the flattened grid and calculate the absolute difference between each element and the median, then divide by x. Sum these results.
    * **Return the sum:** Return the total number of operations.

**In essence, the solution involves:**

* Verifying if a uni-value grid is possible (modulo check).
* Finding the optimal target value (median).
* Calculating the total number of operations required.
