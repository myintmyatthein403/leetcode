Let's explore two real-world examples where this type of problem-solving could be applied.

**1. Manufacturing Calibration**

* **Scenario:** Imagine a factory that produces components with very precise dimensions. Each component's dimension is measured, and the measurements are stored in a 2D grid representing batches of products. The manufacturing process has a calibration setting `x`, which represents the smallest unit of adjustment possible.
* **Problem:** The factory wants to minimize the number of calibration adjustments needed to bring all components within a batch to a uniform dimension.
* **Application:**
    * The `grid` would represent the measured dimensions of the components.
    * `x` would represent the calibration adjustment unit.
    * The `minOperations` function would calculate the minimum number of adjustments needed to unify the dimensions, helping the factory optimize its calibration process and reduce waste.
    * If the function returns -1, that would mean that the machines are not able to be calibrated to produce uniform components.

**2. Image Processing Normalization**

* **Scenario:** In image processing, you might have a 2D grid representing the pixel intensities of an image. You want to normalize the image by bringing all pixel intensities to a common value. However, the image processing software has a limited adjustment step `x`.
* **Problem:** You need to determine the fewest number of adjustment steps to normalize the image's pixel intensities.
* **Application:**
    * The `grid` would represent the pixel intensities of the image.
    * `x` would represent the adjustment step size.
    * The `minOperations` function would calculate the minimum number of steps needed to normalize the image, optimizing the image processing workflow.
    * A return value of -1 would mean that the image can not be normalized with the given adjustment step.

These examples illustrate how the core logic of the problem can be applied to diverse real-world situations involving optimization and uniformity.
