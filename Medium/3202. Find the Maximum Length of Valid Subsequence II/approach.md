To solve **Leetcode 3202: Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence II**, we need a strategy to find the **longest subsequence** where the condition

> `(sub[i - 1] + sub[i]) % k == constant`
> holds for all consecutive pairs in the subsequence.

## üîç Key Insight

The property is based on the **pairwise sum modulo k** being **constant** across all adjacent elements in the subsequence.

So we want to find the **longest subsequence** where:

* For every consecutive pair `(a, b)`, the value `(a + b) % k` is **equal**.

## üß† Strategy and Approach (No Code)

### 1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Idea**

We can model this problem using a variation of **Longest Subsequence** with custom transition rules based on `(a + b) % k`.

* For each element `nums[i]`, we try to extend the longest valid subsequences ending at earlier indices `j < i`.

* For each previous index `j`, if `(nums[j] + nums[i]) % k == some constant`, then `nums[i]` can extend the subsequence ending at `j`.

* Use a **DP table** to store the length of the longest valid subsequence ending at index `i`, for each possible `(a + b) % k` value.

---

### 2. **DP State Definition**

Let:

* `dp[i][mod]` = the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i` with pair sum modulo `k` equal to `mod`.

We iterate through all pairs `(j, i)` where `j < i`, compute `(nums[j] + nums[i]) % k`, and try to update `dp[i][mod]` based on `dp[j][mod]`.

---

### 3. **Optimization & Tracking**

* Since `k ‚â§ 1000`, there are only `k` possible modulo values.
* Maintain a rolling structure like a dictionary or 2D array to store the best subsequence length for each `(index, mod)`.

---

### 4. **Final Result**

* The maximum among all values in the `dp` table gives the **longest valid subsequence** length.

---

## üß© Why It Works

The condition is transitive over consecutive elements:
If `(a + b) % k == x` and `(b + c) % k == x`, then the sequence `[a, b, c]` satisfies the rule.

This lets us build up longer subsequences step by step.

---

## ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time:** O(n¬≤), since we examine all pairs `(i, j)` with `j < i`.
* **Space:** O(n √ó k), for storing DP states based on each index and modulo class.
