To solve the problem of constructing the lexicographically largest valid sequence given an integer `n`, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Constraints**:
   - The integer `1` occurs exactly once in the sequence.
   - Each integer from `2` to `n` occurs exactly twice.
   - For each integer `i` (where `2 <= i <= n`), the distance between the two occurrences of `i` is exactly `i`.

2. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - A sequence is lexicographically larger if, at the first differing position, it has a larger number compared to another sequence.

3. **Approach**:
   - Start by initializing an array of size `2n-1` with zeros or placeholders.
   - Place the largest number `n` first, ensuring the distance constraint is met.
   - Continue placing the next largest number (`n-1`, `n-2`, etc.) in the remaining positions, always ensuring the distance constraint is satisfied.
   - Place the number `1` in the remaining position.

4. **Backtracking**:
   - Use a backtracking approach to try placing each number from `n` to `1` in the sequence.
   - If a valid position is found for a number, place it and move to the next number.
   - If no valid position is found, backtrack and try a different position for the previous number.

5. **Validation**:
   - Ensure that each placement respects the distance constraint.
   - Ensure that the sequence remains lexicographically larger by always trying to place the largest possible number at each step.

By following this approach, we can construct the lexicographically largest valid sequence for any given `n`.
