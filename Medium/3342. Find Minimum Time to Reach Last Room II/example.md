Here are **2 real-world examples** and **1 web development example** where the logic in **"Find Minimum Time to Reach Last Room II"** (alternating move costs, constrained scheduling, and shortest-path logic) is applicable:

---

### ✅ Real-World Example 1: **Robot in a Factory with Alternating Speed Modes**

**Scenario**: A robot moves through a factory grid where:

* Each section has safety regulations (`moveTime`) that only allow the robot to enter after a certain time (e.g., hazardous processes must finish first).
* The robot alternates between **fast mode** (1s movement) and **safe mode** (2s movement) for mechanical safety.

**Relevance**:

* Similar to alternating step durations.
* Factory zones impose entry constraints like `moveTime[i][j]`.

---

### ✅ Real-World Example 2: **Emergency Evacuation Planning**

**Scenario**: In a smart building evacuation system:

* Rooms and hallways become accessible only after certain times (due to fire doors unlocking, smoke clearing, etc.).
* People move alternately fast and slow due to panic, crowding, or terrain (stairs take longer every second step).

**Relevance**:

* Route planning requires optimizing arrival time while respecting access time constraints and movement rhythm.

### ✅ Web Development Example: **Multiplayer Online Game Pathfinding with Timed Buff Zones**

**Scenario**: A turn-based strategy game where:

* A player moves across a grid map.
* Some tiles can only be entered **after a cooldown** (`moveTime`).
* Movement cost alternates (e.g., sprint and cooldown turns).

**Relevance**:

* Backend logic (e.g., Node.js + TypeScript) may use similar pathfinding with constraints for real-time strategy decisions.
* This logic ensures **fair, optimized movement resolution** between clients.
