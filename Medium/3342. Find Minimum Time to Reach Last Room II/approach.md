To solve the problem of finding the **minimum time to reach the last room** `(n-1, m-1)` with alternating move times and time constraints per room, here's the **approach and reasoning** (without code):

### üß† Key Concepts:

1. **Grid Movement with Constraints**:

   * You can only move to adjacent rooms (up, down, left, right).
   * Moving alternates between **1 second** and **2 seconds** for each move (like walking and resting).
   * You **cannot enter a room before its `moveTime[i][j]`**.

2. **Time-Dependent Movement**:

   * You start at `(0, 0)` at time `t = 0`.
   * The move time alternates: 1s, 2s, 1s, 2s, ...
   * Each time you want to move to a neighbor, you must:

     * Wait until both:

       * The **current time** is valid to start moving.
       * The **arrival time** is ‚â• `moveTime[next_i][next_j]`.

### üîç Strategy:

1. **Use a Priority Queue (like Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm)**:

   * Since movement time depends on alternating steps and earliest arrival, this is similar to **shortest path with varying weights and constraints**.
   * Each queue state includes:

     * The current position `(i, j)`.
     * The current time `t`.
     * The move phase (even for 1s move, odd for 2s move).

2. **For each step**:

   * Consider moving in all 4 directions.
   * Calculate:

     * The **next move duration** (1s or 2s based on phase).
     * The **earliest time you can start moving** (‚â• `moveTime[next_i][next_j]`).
     * The **arrival time** (start time + move duration).
   * Push the neighbor state with updated time and phase into the queue **only if it's faster** than any previously recorded time for that state.

3. **Track Visited States Carefully**:

   * Because the cost to a cell depends on both time and the phase (1s or 2s), track visited cells with the phase to avoid unnecessary recomputation.

4. **Stop When You Reach `(n-1, m-1)`**:

   * As this is a Dijkstra-like process, the first time you reach the end cell with the minimum time is your answer.

### üß≠ Summary:

* Use a **priority queue** to always explore the **earliest possible state**.
* Alternate move duration between 1s and 2s.
* Wait if needed to satisfy `moveTime[i][j]` constraint.
* Optimize like Dijkstra, track each room with both **time and move phase**.
