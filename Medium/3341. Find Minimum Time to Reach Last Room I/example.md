Here are **2 real-world use cases** and **1 web development example** where the approach used in this LeetCode problem (a modified **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm with wait constraints**) applies directly:

## ‚úÖ Real-World Example 1: **Airport Gate Scheduling**

### Scenario:

Planes must move from the runway to gates. However, each gate is only available after a certain time (cleaning, previous flight departure).

### How it maps:

* Each **gate** is like a **cell in the grid** with a `moveTime[i][j]`.
* Planes **move from node to node**, waiting if a gate isn‚Äôt ready.
* The goal is to **minimize total taxi + wait time** to reach the final gate.

## ‚úÖ Real-World Example 2: **Warehouse Robot Navigation with Delays**

### Scenario:

A robot in an automated warehouse must pick items in a grid of shelves. Some aisles are blocked temporarily (e.g., other robots passing or dynamic shelf movements).

### How it maps:

* Grid = warehouse layout.
* `moveTime[i][j]` = earliest time the robot can enter that aisle or area.
* Goal: reach the final pick-up zone **as early as possible**, waiting if necessary.

## üåê Web Development Example: **Progressive Job Queue Execution**

### Scenario:

A background job system (like a CI/CD pipeline) has tasks in stages. Some tasks can't run until a specific time due to rate-limits, cooldowns, or dependencies (e.g., API limits, billing cycle windows).

### How it maps:

* Each task or stage is a **node** with a time constraint: `moveTime[i][j]`.
* The job engine computes the **earliest completion time** for all tasks using a similar **priority queue** and **wait time logic**.
* Helps build **efficient and fair async processing systems**.
