To solve **"Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND"**, here‚Äôs the step-by-step **approach and explanation (no code)**:

### üß† Understanding the Problem:

You're given an array `nums`, and you need to:

1. **Find the maximum possible value** from the **bitwise AND** of any **subarray**.
2. Then, **among all subarrays** that result in this maximum bitwise AND value, **return the length of the longest** one.

---

### üîç Key Observations:

* Bitwise AND is **monotonic non-increasing**:

  * That means, as you keep including more elements in a subarray, the result of the AND operation **can only stay the same or decrease**.
  * Example:
    `AND(3, 3) = 3`
    `AND(3, 2) = 2`
    `AND(3, 3, 2) = 2`
  * So the **maximum AND** of any subarray is achieved by **contiguous identical or high-valued elements**, not by mixing many different numbers.

---

### üß≠ Step-by-Step Approach:

#### 1. **Identify the Maximum Value** in the array:

* Since **any AND of numbers is less than or equal to the minimum among them**, the **maximum value in the array** is a natural candidate for the **maximum bitwise AND**.
* No subarray can have an AND result higher than the maximum single element.

#### 2. **Look for Contiguous Subarrays** with that Max Value:

* Only subarrays where all elements are equal to this maximum value can maintain the maximum AND.
* This simplifies the problem: just scan the array and look for **longest runs of the max value**.

#### 3. **Track the Longest Streak**:

* While iterating:

  * If current number equals the max value, increase streak count.
  * Else, reset streak.
  * Keep track of the **maximum streak length**.

### ‚úÖ Final Insight:

* We don‚Äôt need to try every possible subarray or compute ANDs over ranges.
* We only care about sequences of the **maximum element** in the array.
* The answer is the length of the **longest contiguous block of that max element**.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:

* **O(n)** ‚Äì Single pass through the array to:

  * Find the max value.
  * Track the longest subarray of that value.

This problem is a great example of how **understanding bitwise properties** allows for **optimization by narrowing the search space**.
