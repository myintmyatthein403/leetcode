To solve the problem of checking if a number can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three, you can follow this approach:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - You need to determine if a given integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of three (e.g., \(3^0, 3^1, 3^2, \ldots\)).

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Use a greedy algorithm to subtract the largest possible power of three from `n` until `n` becomes zero or it is no longer possible to subtract a power of three.

3. **Steps**:
   - Start with the largest power of three that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Subtract this power of three from `n`.
   - Repeat the process with the remaining value of `n`.
   - If `n` becomes zero, return `true`.
   - If you cannot subtract any more powers of three and `n` is not zero, return `false`.

Here is a Python implementation of the approach:

```python
def checkPowersOfThree(n: int) -> bool:
    power = 1
    while power <= n:
        power *= 3
    
    while n > 0:
        power //= 3
        if n >= power:
            n -= power
    
    return n == 0
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialize Power**:
   - Start with `power = 1` (which is \(3^0\)).
   - Multiply `power` by 3 until it exceeds `n`.

2. **Subtract Powers of Three**:
   - Divide `power` by 3 to get the largest power of three less than or equal to `n`.
   - Subtract this power from `n` if `n` is greater than or equal to this power.
   - Repeat until `n` becomes zero or no more powers of three can be subtracted.

3. **Check Result**:
   - If `n` is zero after the loop, return `true`.
   - Otherwise, return `false`.

This approach ensures that you are always subtracting the largest possible power of three, which helps in efficiently determining if `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three.
