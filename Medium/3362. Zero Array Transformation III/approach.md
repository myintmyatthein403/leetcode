### 🧩 Problem Summary

* You are given:

  * An array `nums` of integers.
  * A list of `queries`, where each query defines a range `[li, ri]`.

* For each query, **you can decrement each index in `[li, ri]` by at most 1**.

  * Importantly, you **choose how much to decrement each individual index (0 or 1)** per query.

* A **Zero Array** means all values in `nums` become zero after all query applications.

---

### 🎯 Objective

Remove as **many queries as possible**, while still being able to convert `nums` into a zero array **using the remaining queries**.

Return:

* The **maximum number of queries you can remove** while still achieving a zero array.
* Or `-1` if even using **all queries**, you can't make `nums` zero.

---

### 🔍 Key Observations

1. **Flexibility in decrements**: Since we can decrement **by at most 1**, and choose 0 or 1 per index per query, we can **distribute decrements smartly** across queries.

2. **Minimum requirements**:

   * To make `nums[i] = 0`, we need to apply **at least `nums[i]` total decrements** on index `i`.
   * So, we must ensure that the **total number of queries covering index `i` is ≥ nums\[i]**.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Approach

#### Step 1: Preprocess Needed Decrements

For each index `i`, you **need at least `nums[i]` decrements**.

So, for the array to become all zeros, the **number of queries that cover index `i` must be ≥ nums\[i]**.

If any index has **fewer total queries than its `nums[i]`**, it is **impossible** → return `-1`.

---

#### Step 2: Greedy Query Removal

You now want to **remove as many queries as possible** while still having **enough coverage** (decrement opportunities) per index.

Idea:

* Imagine each index `i` has a **budget of needed decrements** = `nums[i]`.
* Each query that covers index `i` **contributes one potential decrement** to that index.

Now:

* The **minimal valid set** of queries is the smallest subset that still gives **enough coverage** to all indices.
* So, **you want to remove all "extra" queries** (those that don't reduce you below any index’s need).

---

#### Step 3: Reverse Thinking + Binary Search

To find the **maximum number of queries to remove**, you can:

1. Use **binary search** on `k = number of queries to remove`:

   * Try removing `k` queries.
   * Check if remaining queries still give **enough coverage** to satisfy `nums`.

2. **Check function**:

   * Build a `coverage` array (size of `nums`) initialized to 0.
   * For each remaining query, increment the coverage of its range.
   * At the end, check that `coverage[i] ≥ nums[i]` for all `i`.

3. Binary search on `k` from `0` to `len(queries)`, and find the **largest `k` where the check passes**.

---

### 🔁 Summary

* You need each `nums[i]` to have at least that many total decrements → at least that many queries covering `i`.
* The more overlapping queries you have, the more flexibility you gain to remove extras.
* The problem becomes finding the **maximum number of queries you can remove** while still covering every `nums[i]`.

---

### 💡 Edge Case

* If even with **all queries**, any `nums[i] > coverage[i]`, then return `-1` immediately.
