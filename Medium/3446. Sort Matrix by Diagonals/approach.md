Got it 👍 Let’s carefully break down the problem and the **approach** to solve **[3446. Sort Matrix by Diagonals](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-matrix-by-diagonals/)**.

## 🔎 Understanding the Problem

We are given an `n x n` matrix. Each diagonal runs from **top-left to bottom-right**.

We need to:

1. Sort **bottom-left triangle diagonals** (including the main diagonal) in **non-increasing order** (descending).
2. Sort **top-right triangle diagonals** in **non-decreasing order** (ascending).

### Key Observations

* Each diagonal can be identified by the difference `(row - col)`:

  * `row - col >= 0` → diagonal belongs to bottom-left triangle (including the main diagonal).
  * `row - col < 0` → diagonal belongs to top-right triangle.
* Each diagonal is independent. Sorting one does not affect another since they don’t overlap.
* Since `n ≤ 10`, performance is not a concern—we can afford to extract and sort each diagonal.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Approach

### Step 1: Group elements by diagonals

* Each element `(i, j)` belongs to a diagonal uniquely identified by `i - j`.
* Example:

  ```
  grid = [[1,7,3],
          [9,8,2],
          [4,5,6]]

  Diagonal groups:
  i-j = 0: [1, 8, 6]
  i-j = 1: [9, 5]
  i-j = 2: [4]
  i-j = -1: [7, 2]
  i-j = -2: [3]
  ```

### Step 2: Sort diagonals

* If `i - j >= 0` → sort diagonal **descending** (non-increasing).
* If `i - j < 0` → sort diagonal **ascending** (non-decreasing).
* Example:

  * `i-j=0: [1, 8, 6] → [8, 6, 1]`
  * `i-j=-1: [7, 2] → [2, 7]`

### Step 3: Write back into grid

* Place sorted values back into their respective diagonal positions in the matrix.

### Step 4: Return the updated grid

* The matrix is now sorted according to the rules.

## 📊 Example Walkthrough

Input:

```
grid = [[1,7,3],
        [9,8,2],
        [4,5,6]]
```

* Extract:

  * i-j=0 → \[1,8,6]
  * i-j=1 → \[9,5]
  * i-j=2 → \[4]
  * i-j=-1 → \[7,2]
  * i-j=-2 → \[3]

* Sort:

  * i-j=0 → \[8,6,1] (descending)
  * i-j=1 → \[9,5] (descending)
  * i-j=2 → \[4] (no change)
  * i-j=-1 → \[2,7] (ascending)
  * i-j=-2 → \[3] (no change)

* Place back:

```
[[8,2,3],
 [9,6,7],
 [4,5,1]]
```

✅ Matches expected output.

## ⏱️ Complexity

* Extracting all diagonals: **O(n²)**
* Sorting each diagonal: Each diagonal length ≤ n, so total sorting cost is **O(n² log n)** (very small since n ≤ 10).
* Writing back: **O(n²)**

So overall: **O(n² log n)**, efficient for given constraints.

👉 In short:
**Group by diagonals → sort depending on position (top-right or bottom-left) → put back into grid.**
