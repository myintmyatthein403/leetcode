Your function `numberOfPairs(points)` solves a **geometric filtering problem**: finding valid point pairs (A, B) that form an empty rectangle with A at the upper-left of B.

While the specific task is framed in terms of a LeetCode-style challenge, this kind of **geometric spatial filtering** is widely applicable in **real-world software**, especially in areas involving **2D spatial analysis**.

## üîß Real-World Usage Examples

---

### üó∫ 1. **Mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**

* **Scenario**: You are building a map visualization tool, and you want to identify **empty zones between two landmarks** (e.g., buildings or sensors) to place something new (e.g., a camera or utility pole).
* **Use**: Your function can help determine whether a rectangular region between two points is **unoccupied** by other objects.
* **How it's used**: Check for clear line-of-sight or empty plots in a city block map.

---

### üß± 2. **UI/UX Layout Engines**

* **Scenario**: In web or mobile UI layout engines, especially ones that use **manual or visual placement of widgets** (like drag-and-drop editors), we may need to ensure widgets don't overlap.
* **Use**: This function could help determine if there's room to place a new component between two existing ones, ensuring the space is **unoccupied**.
* **Example**: In a dashboard editor, find places to auto-suggest widget placement between two anchors.

### üßÆ 3. **Collision Detection in Game Development**

* **Scenario**: You are designing a grid-based game and want to determine whether a player can "dash" or teleport from point A to B.
* **Use**: Your function can verify if the path (rectangle or line between A and B) is free of enemies, traps, or other players.
* **Application**: Logic behind line-of-sight movement or AoE (Area of Effect) placement in a strategy or puzzle game.

## üåê Web Development Use Cases

---

### üìê 4. **SVG or Canvas-based Drawing Tools**

* **Scenario**: In a browser-based design tool (e.g., Figma, Canva), users select two points and the system suggests snapping to a grid or adds a new shape between them.
* **Use**: Your function ensures there's **no overlap** with existing elements before placing a new one between the selected points.

---

### üèó 5. **DOM Element Placement Validation**

* **Scenario**: You have a dynamic layout system that programmatically inserts new DOM elements.
* **Use**: Before placing an element between two others, check whether the rectangular area is already occupied by existing elements using bounding boxes.

---

### üìä 6. **Heatmap / Data Visualization Integrity**

* **Scenario**: In a heatmap (e.g., sales data by region), you want to detect empty rectangular zones to annotate or highlight gaps in the data.
* **Use**: Your function helps detect regions between data points that contain no values.

## ü§ñ Summary

While your function may look like a LeetCode challenge, its **core logic (empty rectangle detection between two points)** is a fundamental operation used in:

| Domain                  | Real Use Case                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| GIS / Mapping           | Empty land or clear path detection                         |
| UI Design / UX Engines  | Auto-placement, snap-to-grid, or layout conflict detection |
| Game Development        | Line-of-sight, teleport, or AoE checks                     |
| Web Visualization Tools | Collision checks in drawing or data tools                  |
| Dynamic Web Layout      | DOM element placement, overlap detection                   |
