To solve **Leetcode 3025: Find the Number of Ways to Place People I**, we need to **count valid pairs of points (A, B)** that satisfy two conditions:

---

### ‚úÖ **Conditions for a Valid Pair (A, B)**

1. **A is on the upper-left side of B**:

   * `A.x < B.x` (to the left)
   * `A.y > B.y` (above)

2. **No other point lies inside or on the border** of the rectangle formed by A and B.

   * The rectangle spans from:

     * left = `A.x`
     * right = `B.x`
     * top = `A.y`
     * bottom = `B.y`

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Approach

### Step 1: Brute-force All Pairs (A, B)

Loop through all possible pairs of points `(i, j)` such that `i ‚â† j`. Since `n` is small (`n ‚â§ 50`), we can afford a **brute-force** approach with some optimization.

For each pair:

* Check if `A` is on the upper-left side of `B`:

  * `A.x < B.x` and `A.y > B.y`

If yes, move to next step.

---

### Step 2: Check if the Rectangle Is Empty

For a valid pair `(A, B)`, ensure **no other point (including A and B)** lies **inside or on the border** of the rectangle formed between A and B, except the points themselves.

* Iterate over all other points `P` (excluding A and B).
* For each point `P`, check if:

  ```text
  A.x ‚â§ P.x ‚â§ B.x and B.y ‚â§ P.y ‚â§ A.y
  ```

  If **any** such point `P` exists, **reject** the pair.

---

### Step 3: Count Valid Pairs

If no other point lies in the rectangle, the pair `(A, B)` is valid. Increment the count.

## üß† Optimization Insight

* Since the coordinate bounds are small (`‚â§ 50`), you can consider using a **grid (51 x 51)** to map the presence of each point. This would allow faster lookups instead of scanning all points when checking if the rectangle is empty.
* But for this version of the problem (`n ‚â§ 50`), iterating is fast enough and easy to implement.

---

## ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity**:

  * O(n¬≤ \* n) = O(n¬≥), where:

    * O(n¬≤) for all pairs,
    * O(n) for checking each rectangle.
  * For `n = 50`, this is acceptable (\~125,000 iterations max).

* **Space Complexity**:

  * O(1) extra space, unless you use a grid for faster point lookup.

## üß™ Example Clarification (Example 2)

Input: `[[6,2],[4,4],[2,6]]`

Sorted diagram:

* Point 0: \[6,2]
* Point 1: \[4,4]
* Point 2: \[2,6]

Valid pairs:

* (1,0): \[4,4] is upper-left of \[6,2]; the rectangle is empty.
* (2,1): \[2,6] is upper-left of \[4,4]; rectangle is empty.
* (2,0): \[2,6] is upper-left of \[6,2]; but \[4,4] is **inside** the rectangle ‚Üí invalid.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

To solve the problem:

1. Loop over all pairs of points `(A, B)` such that A is upper-left of B.
2. For each such pair, check if the rectangle formed by A and B is empty (excluding A and B).
3. If empty, count the pair.

Since `n` is small, brute-force is efficient enough.
