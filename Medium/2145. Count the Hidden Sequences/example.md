Great! Here are **two real-world examples** and **one web development use case** for this kind of algorithm ‚Äî all based on the core idea of reconstructing a sequence from *differences* under constraints.

### ‚úÖ **Real-World Example 1: GPS Tracking & Movement Constraints**

**Scenario**: You're analyzing a delivery vehicle‚Äôs route. You have the **change in elevation** between each checkpoint (`differences`), and the allowed elevation range (e.g., 100m to 300m). You want to find out how many possible starting elevations the vehicle could have had to ensure that the whole route stays within safe elevation levels.

- `differences` = change in elevation at each point.
- `lower`, `upper` = allowed safe altitude range.
- Goal: Find the number of valid starting elevations.

### ‚úÖ **Real-World Example 2: Financial Account Balance Tracking**

**Scenario**: You only know how someone's account balance changed daily (e.g., deposits and withdrawals). You want to determine how many possible starting balances are possible such that their balance never drops below a minimum threshold or exceeds a maximum (like overdraft protection or fraud limits).

- `differences` = daily changes in account balance.
- `lower`, `upper` = allowed range of account balance (e.g., $0 to $5000).
- Goal: Find the number of starting balances that would keep the account within limits every day.

### üåê **Web Development Use Case: Animation Sequences with Position Constraints**

**Scenario**: You're building a web animation where an element moves based on a list of position differences (like a timeline of X or Y movement). You want to compute how many different **starting positions** the animation can begin with, such that the entire animation stays inside a visible bounding box (e.g., a container div).

- `differences` = list of pixel differences in movement.
- `lower`, `upper` = container bounds (e.g., from 0px to 800px).
- This helps generate valid starting points or validate user-generated animations that won‚Äôt overflow.
