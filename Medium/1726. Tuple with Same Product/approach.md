To solve the problem of finding the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that `a * b = c * d` where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct elements from the array `nums`, you can follow this approach:

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each product of pairs `(a, b)`.

2. **Generate Pairs**: Iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` in the array `nums` and calculate their product. Store the product in the dictionary with the count of how many times each product appears.

3. **Count Valid Tuples**: For each product that appears more than once in the dictionary, calculate the number of valid tuples. If a product appears `k` times, the number of ways to choose 2 pairs from `k` pairs is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. Each pair can form 8 valid tuples `(a, b, c, d)` due to permutations.

4. **Sum Up**: Sum up the counts of valid tuples for all products to get the final result.

This approach ensures that you efficiently count the number of valid tuples by leveraging the properties of combinations and permutations.
