1. **E-commerce Product Bundling**:
   In an e-commerce platform, you might want to identify pairs of products that are frequently bought together. By analyzing the product pairs that have the same total price, you can create bundles or recommend similar product combinations to customers. This can help in increasing sales and improving customer experience.

2. **Genetic Research**:
   In genetic research, scientists often look for pairs of genes that interact with each other in similar ways across different organisms. By identifying pairs of genes that produce the same effect or product, researchers can better understand genetic interactions and potentially discover new genetic pathways or targets for medical treatments.
