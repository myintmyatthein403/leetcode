To solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of a pair with equal sum of digits, you can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Digit Sums**: For each number in the input list, calculate the sum of its digits.
2. **Group by Digit Sums**: Use a dictionary to group numbers by their digit sums. The keys will be the digit sums, and the values will be lists of numbers that have the same digit sum.
3. **Find Maximum Pair Sums**: For each group of numbers with the same digit sum, find the two largest numbers and calculate their sum. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.
4. **Return Result**: If no valid pairs are found, return -1. Otherwise, return the maximum sum found.

This approach ensures that you efficiently group numbers and find the maximum sum of pairs with equal digit sums.
