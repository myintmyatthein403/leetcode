### Real World Examples of Usage

1. **Financial Transactions Analysis**:
   In a financial system, you might have a list of transaction amounts. To detect patterns or anomalies, you could use this approach to find pairs of transactions that have the same digit sum and analyze their combined impact. For example, if two large transactions have the same digit sum, it might indicate a pattern worth investigating further.

2. **Inventory Management**:
   In an inventory management system, you might have a list of product quantities. By finding pairs of products with the same digit sum in their quantities, you could optimize storage or shipping processes. For instance, if two products with the same digit sum are frequently ordered together, you might decide to store them closer to each other in the warehouse to streamline the picking process.
