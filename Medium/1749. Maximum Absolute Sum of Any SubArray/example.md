Here are two real-world scenarios where finding the **maximum absolute sum of a subarray** is useful:

### **1. Stock Market Analysis (Profit & Loss Fluctuations)**
- **Scenario:** You have a daily record of stock price changes (profits/losses) for a company, and you want to determine the biggest market fluctuation (either gain or loss) over any continuous period.
- **Example:**  
  ```js
  let stockChanges = [5, -7, 6, 3, -2, 4, -8];
  console.log(maxAbsoluteSum(stockChanges)); // Output: 10
  ```
  - This helps investors assess the worst-case risk (largest negative fluctuation) or the best profit streak.

### **2. Financial Accounting (Tracking Budget Surplus & Deficits)**
- **Scenario:** A business tracks its daily cash flow (positive = surplus, negative = deficit), and they want to determine the most extreme financial swing over any period.
- **Example:**  
  ```js
  let cashFlow = [200, -500, 100, -300, 400, -200];
  console.log(maxAbsoluteSum(cashFlow)); // Output: 700
  ```
  - This helps companies prepare for financial stability by identifying the biggest swings in net cash flow.

### **Why This is Useful?**
- Helps in **risk management** by identifying worst-case losses.
- Aids in **decision-making** by recognizing peak performance periods.
- Can be used in **machine learning & data analytics** for anomaly detection.
