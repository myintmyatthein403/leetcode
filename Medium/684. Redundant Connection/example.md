Here are two real-world examples where detecting and removing redundant connections in a graph can be useful:

1. **Network Design and Optimization**:
   - In computer networks, routers and switches are connected to form a network. Sometimes, additional connections are added for redundancy to ensure network reliability.
   - However, these additional connections can create cycles, leading to issues like broadcast storms.
   - Using the approach described, network administrators can identify and remove redundant connections to maintain a tree-like structure, ensuring efficient and loop-free network topology.

2. **Electrical Grid Management**:
   - Electrical grids are designed to distribute power from power plants to consumers. The grid is often designed as a tree to ensure that power flows efficiently without loops.
   - When new connections are added to the grid for redundancy or expansion, they can create cycles, leading to potential overloads or inefficiencies.
   - By applying the redundant connection detection algorithm, grid operators can identify and remove unnecessary connections, ensuring the grid remains a tree and operates efficiently.

These examples illustrate how the algorithm can be applied to maintain optimal and efficient structures in various networked systems.
