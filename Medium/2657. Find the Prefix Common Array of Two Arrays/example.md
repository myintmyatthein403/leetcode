### Real World Example of Usage

1. **Comparing User Preferences**:
   - Suppose you have two users on a streaming platform, and you want to compare their preferences over time. Each user's preferences are represented as an array of genres they have watched. By finding the prefix common array, you can determine how similar their preferences are at each point in time.
   - For example:
     ```javascript
     let userA = ['Action', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Horror'];
     let userB = ['Action', 'Drama', 'Comedy', 'Horror'];
     let commonArray = findThePrefixCommonArray(userA, userB);
     console.log(commonArray); // Output: [1, 1, 2, 3]
     ```
   - This output indicates that initially, both users have 1 common genre, then 1 common genre again, then 2 common genres, and finally 3 common genres.

2. **Tracking Inventory Changes**:
   - Imagine you are managing two warehouses, and you want to track the common items in their inventories over time. Each warehouse's inventory is represented as an array of items received in chronological order. By finding the prefix common array, you can monitor how the inventories align over time.
   - For example:
     ```javascript
     let warehouseA = ['Item1', 'Item2', 'Item3', 'Item4'];
     let warehouseB = ['Item1', 'Item3', 'Item2', 'Item4'];
     let commonArray = findThePrefixCommonArray(warehouseA, warehouseB);
     console.log(commonArray); // Output: [1, 1, 2, 3]
     ```
   - This output shows that initially, both warehouses have 1 common item, then 1 common item again, then 2 common items, and finally 3 common items.

These examples demonstrate how the prefix common array can be used to compare and track similarities in different contexts over time.
