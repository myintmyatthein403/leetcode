The problem **"Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem"** might seem theoretical, but it reflects **real-world applications** in **file system management**, **URL routing**, and **hierarchical data processing**. Here are some practical examples:

---

### 🔧 **1. Real World: File System Cleanup & Deduplication**

**Scenario:**
You’re building a desktop file cleaner tool (like CCleaner). Users may select folders to exclude from cleanup.

**Problem:**
If a user excludes `/documents`, you **don’t need to separately exclude** `/documents/reports`, `/documents/reports/2023`, etc.

**Use Case:**
This algorithm helps you **deduplicate** subfolder exclusions for better performance and UX.

### 🌐 **2. Web Development: URL Routing in Frameworks**

**Scenario:**
In a web app like Next.js or Express.js, you define routes:

```plaintext
/blog
/blog/posts
/blog/posts/2023
/about
```

**Problem:**
You might want to **register only the top-level routes** to avoid redundancy or prioritize route handling.

**Use Case:**
Use this logic to **remove nested routes** or define route guards/middleware efficiently (e.g., authentication only at `/admin` instead of each subroute).

---

### 📂 **3. Software Development: Access Control (ACL) Systems**

**Scenario:**
You’re designing a permission system for folders in a cloud drive app (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).

**Problem:**
If user A has access to `/company`, you don’t need to assign access to `/company/docs`, `/company/docs/policies`, etc.

**Use Case:**
Use this algorithm to **collapse inherited access paths**, simplifying permission trees and reducing storage/computation.

---

### 📊 **4. DevOps & Infrastructure: Path Filtering in CI/CD Pipelines**

**Scenario:**
In a CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins), you define folders that should trigger builds:

```yaml
on:
  paths:
    - 'src/'
    - 'src/utils/'
    - 'src/utils/helpers/'
```

**Problem:**
Having subpaths is redundant if a parent path is already included.

**Use Case:**
Apply this algorithm to **filter out redundant paths**, optimizing build triggers.

---

### 🧠 **5. Search Indexing or Caching**

**Scenario:**
A crawler or search engine (like Algolia or Elasticsearch) indexes site content.

**Problem:**
If `/products` is already indexed and it includes subpages, you might skip crawling `/products/electronics`.

**Use Case:**
Prevent **duplicate or unnecessary indexing** of subfolders/subroutes.
