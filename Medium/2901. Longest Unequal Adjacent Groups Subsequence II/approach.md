To solve the problem **2901. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence II**, the core idea is to model the constraints as a graph and then find the longest valid path (or subsequence) satisfying the conditions.

---

### **Understanding the Problem**

You're given:

* An array of strings `words`.
* An integer array `groups`, where each word belongs to a group.
* You need to select a **subsequence of indices** such that:

  1. **Adjacent words** in the subsequence belong to **different groups**.
  2. Their lengths are equal, and the **Hamming distance** is exactly **1**.

The goal is to **maximize the length** of this subsequence and return the **corresponding words**.

### **Constraints to Encode**

Let’s denote the indices of the selected subsequence as `[i0, i1, ..., ik-1]`. Then, for all adjacent pairs `(ij, ij+1)`:

* `groups[ij] != groups[ij+1]` (unequal adjacent groups)
* `len(words[ij]) == len(words[ij+1])`
* `hamming(words[ij], words[ij+1]) == 1`

---

### **High-Level Approach (Graph + DP)**

1. **Model as a Directed Graph**:

   * Each word is a node.
   * Create a **directed edge from node i to node j** if:

     * `groups[i] != groups[j]`
     * `len(words[i]) == len(words[j])`
     * `hamming(words[i], words[j]) == 1`

   This ensures that if you move from node `i` to node `j`, you are making a valid transition.

2. **Build the Graph Efficiently**:

   * For all words of the same length, compare all pairs.
   * Compute the Hamming distance only for same-length words.
   * Avoid comparing words of different lengths.

3. **Find the Longest Path** in this Directed Graph:

   * Use **Dynamic Programming with memoization** or **topological sorting** (since this graph is a DAG — no cycles because no backtracking allowed).
   * For each node `i`, store `dp[i] = length of longest valid path starting at i`.

4. **Reconstruct the Path**:

   * Track the next node for each best path.
   * Reconstruct the longest path using the DP results.

5. **Return the Words** in order of the selected indices.

### **Complexity Consideration**

* **Time Complexity**:

  * Pairwise comparison within words of the same length is `O(n^2)` in worst case.
  * Hamming distance computation per pair is `O(L)` (L = word length).
  * So total: `O(n^2 * L)` in worst case. May be optimized by grouping.

* **Space Complexity**:

  * `O(n^2)` for the graph (adjacency list).
  * `O(n)` for DP and path tracking.

---

### **Optimizations**

* **Bucket words by length** to limit comparisons only within equal-length words.
* **Preprocess** potential neighbors by generating all possible words with 1 character changed, using wildcards or substitutions.

---

### **Summary of Steps**

1. Group words by their lengths.
2. For each group:

   * Compare all word pairs.
   * If Hamming distance is 1 and group constraint holds, add a directed edge.
3. For each node, run DFS/DP to find the longest path.
4. Track and reconstruct the longest valid path.
5. Return the list of words corresponding to the indices in this path.
