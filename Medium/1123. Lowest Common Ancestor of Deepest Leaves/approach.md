Great question! Here's a clear and structured approach (no code) to solve the problem of **finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of the deepest leaves** in a binary tree.

---

### üîç Goal
Return the **lowest common ancestor** (LCA) of all the **deepest leaves** in the tree.

---

### üß† Key Concepts

- **Deepest leaves**: These are all leaf nodes that are at the maximum depth in the tree.
- **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**: The deepest node that has all the target nodes (in this case, deepest leaves) as descendants.

---

### ü™ú Step-by-Step Approach

#### **Step 1: Traverse the Tree to Get Depth Information**
- Perform a **post-order traversal** (left ‚Üí right ‚Üí node).
- For each node, determine the **depth** of its deepest child.
- While doing this, for each subtree, keep track of:
  - The **maximum depth** found in the subtree.
  - The **LCA** for the deepest nodes in that subtree.

#### **Step 2: Compute LCA Based on Depth**
- At each node:
  - Recursively get the depth and LCA from the **left** and **right** children.
  - Compare the depths:
    - If **left depth > right depth**, return the left result.
    - If **right depth > left depth**, return the right result.
    - If **equal**, it means both subtrees contain deepest leaves at the same depth ‚Üí this node is their **common ancestor**.

#### **Step 3: Return the Final Result**
- The LCA returned from the **root node's traversal** is the answer.

### üß© Why This Works
This method works because:
- It always keeps track of how deep each subtree goes.
- It ensures that we only look for the LCA among the **deepest nodes**, not all leaves.
- It returns the LCA that is **deepest in the tree** while still encompassing all deepest leaves.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree (we visit each node once).
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).
