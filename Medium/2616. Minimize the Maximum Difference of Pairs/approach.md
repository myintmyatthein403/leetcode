To solve the problem **"2616. Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs"**, the goal is to form `p` **non-overlapping pairs** from the array `nums`, such that the **maximum absolute difference** among all chosen pairs is **minimized**.

---

### üîç Key Observations:

1. **We want to form `p` pairs** such that **no element is reused**, and the **maximum difference** across those pairs is **as small as possible**.

2. When you are minimizing the *maximum* of a set, you can use **binary search** as a powerful tool ‚Äî specifically, **binary search on the answer**.

---

### üß† Core Idea:

We use **binary search** on the possible values of the maximum difference (let's call it `maxDiff`). For a given `maxDiff`, we ask:

> ‚ÄúCan we find at least `p` disjoint pairs whose individual differences are all ‚â§ `maxDiff`?‚Äù

If yes, we try a **smaller** `maxDiff`. If not, we try a **larger** one.

---

### ü™ú Steps:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting `nums` will help us to quickly find pairs with minimal differences.

2. **Binary Search** over possible values of the answer:

   * The minimum possible difference is `0`.
   * The maximum difference can be `max(nums) - min(nums)`.

3. **Feasibility Check (Greedy Matching):**

   * After fixing a candidate `maxDiff` (from binary search), traverse the sorted array.
   * Try to form pairs greedily: if the current element and the next one differ by ‚â§ `maxDiff`, count it as a pair and skip both.
   * Continue until you form `p` pairs or run out of elements.

   This works because sorted pairs with smaller differences appear earlier, and greedily choosing them increases the chance of forming more valid pairs.

4. **Return the smallest `maxDiff`** for which we can form `p` valid pairs.

---

### ‚úÖ Why This Works:

* **Binary search** narrows down the minimal `maxDiff` efficiently in `log(range)` time.
* **Greedy pairing** ensures we don't use the same index twice and always select the smallest valid differences.
* Time complexity is dominated by sorting (`O(n log n)`) and binary search with greedy checking (`O(n log m)`), where `m` is the range of possible differences.

---

### üìå Edge Cases:

* If `p == 0`, return `0` immediately.
* If `nums` has very few elements (e.g., 1 or 2), handle accordingly (can‚Äôt form enough pairs).
