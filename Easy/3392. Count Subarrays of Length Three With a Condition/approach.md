Alright! Let’s work through it step-by-step **without code**, just the **thinking process**.

---

### Problem Summary:
- We are given an array `nums`.
- We need to **count** how many **subarrays of length 3** have a special property:
  - The **sum of the first and third elements** equals **half** of the **middle element**.

---

### Approach:

1. **Understand the subarrays we are checking:**
   - Subarrays must have **exactly 3 elements**.
   - So at every position `i` in `nums`, we are checking the elements:
     - `nums[i]` (first)
     - `nums[i+1]` (second/middle)
     - `nums[i+2]` (third)
   - But we must stop at the index `i = len(nums) - 3` because after that, there aren’t enough elements to form a subarray of 3.

2. **Condition to check for each subarray:**
   - Check if:  
     \[
     nums[i] + nums[i+2] = \frac{nums[i+1]}{2}
     \]
   - Notice: 
     - The middle number `nums[i+1]` must be **even** for its half to be an integer, because we’re comparing sums of integers.
     - If `nums[i+1]` is odd, `nums[i+1] / 2` is not an integer, so the condition **cannot** be satisfied with integers.

3. **Step-by-step plan:**
   - Initialize a counter to 0.
   - Loop through `nums` from index 0 to `len(nums) - 3`.
   - For each 3-element window:
     - Check if `nums[i+1]` is divisible by 2.
     - Then check if `nums[i] + nums[i+2]` equals `nums[i+1] / 2`.
     - If yes, increment the counter.

4. **Why this is efficient:**
   - We scan the array **once**, and at each step, we just do **simple math operations**.
   - Overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:  
Input: `[1,2,1,4,1]`
- Subarray [1,2,1]:  
  - nums[0] + nums[2] = 1 + 1 = 2  
  - nums[1]/2 = 2/2 = 1  
  - 2 ≠ 1 → Not valid.
- Subarray [2,1,4]:  
  - nums[1] + nums[3] = 2 + 4 = 6  
  - nums[2]/2 = 1/2 = 0.5 (not an integer) → skip.
- Subarray [1,4,1]:  
  - nums[2] + nums[4] = 1 + 1 = 2  
  - nums[3]/2 = 4/2 = 2  
  - 2 == 2 → ✅ valid.

Thus, **output = 1**.

---

#### Example 2:  
Input: `[1,1,1]`
- Only one subarray [1,1,1]:  
  - nums[0] + nums[2] = 1 + 1 = 2  
  - nums[1]/2 = 1/2 = 0.5 → not an integer → ❌

Thus, **output = 0**.

---

### Short Summary of the Strategy:
- Slide a 3-element window over the array.
- For each window, check if:
  - Middle element is even
  - Sum of first and third equals half the middle.
- Count how many times it happens.
