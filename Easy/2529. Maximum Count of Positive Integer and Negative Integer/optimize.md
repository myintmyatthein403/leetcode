Both implementations solve the problem correctly but have different **time complexities** and **efficiency trade-offs**. Let's compare them.

## **Comparison of Both Approaches**

| Approach | **Binary Search (`maxCount`)** | **Linear Scan (`maximumCount`)** |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Time Complexity** | **O(log n)** (Binary Search) | **O(n)** (Linear Scan) |
| **Space Complexity** | **O(1)** (Constant Space) | **O(1)** (Constant Space) |
| **Best Case Performance** | Fast for large sorted arrays | Simple but slower for large arrays |
| **Worst Case Performance** | Efficient for all cases | Slower for large `nums` |

---

## **Key Differences**

1. **Efficiency**  
   - `maxCount(nums)`: Uses **binary search**, making it much faster for large sorted arrays (**O(log n)**).  
   - `maximumCount(nums)`: Uses a simple **for-loop** to count elements (**O(n)**).  

2. **Readability & Simplicity**  
   - `maxCount(nums)`: More complex but optimized.  
   - `maximumCount(nums)`: Straightforward and easy to understand but slower for large datasets.

3. **Suitability Based on Input Size**  
   - If `nums` has **millions of elements**, **binary search is significantly faster**.  
   - If `nums` is small (e.g., a few hundred elements), both approaches perform similarly.

## **Which One is Better?**
- **For large arrays (`n > 10^5`) â†’ Use `maxCount(nums)` (Binary Search, O(log n))**
- **For small arrays (`n < 10^4`) â†’ `maximumCount(nums)` is fine (O(n))**

If **performance matters**, **binary search is the better choice** since the array is sorted.

ðŸš€ **Winner:** **Binary Search (`maxCount`)** ðŸŽ¯
