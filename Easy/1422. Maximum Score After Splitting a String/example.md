### Example 1: Binary String Analysis

Imagine you have a binary string representing the status of a series of sensors, where '0' indicates a sensor is off and '1' indicates a sensor is on. You want to find the optimal point to split the string into two parts such that the sum of the number of off sensors in the left part and the number of on sensors in the right part is maximized. This code helps you determine that optimal split point.

### Example 2: Network Packet Distribution

Consider a scenario where you have a binary string representing network packets, where '0' indicates a low-priority packet and '1' indicates a high-priority packet. You want to split the string into two parts to maximize the sum of low-priority packets in the first part and high-priority packets in the second part. This code can be used to find the best split point to achieve this goal.
