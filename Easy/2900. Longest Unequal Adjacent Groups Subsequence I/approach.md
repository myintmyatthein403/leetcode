To solve the problem of finding the **longest alternating subsequence** of words based on their associated binary groups, we can use a **greedy approach** with a **single pass** through the input.

### **Understanding the Problem**

You are given:

* A list of words: `words[i]` (each word is distinct).
* A list of binary values: `groups[i]` (either 0 or 1), where each binary value corresponds to a word.

You need to select a **subsequence** of words (not necessarily contiguous), where **adjacent elements in the selected list must have different group values**. This is what we mean by an "alternating" subsequence.

### **Approach (Greedy)**

1. **Initialize an empty list** for the result.
2. **Iterate through the array** from left to right.
3. **Track the group of the last selected word** (initially unset).
4. For each word, decide:

   * If it's the **first word** to be selected, add it.
   * For subsequent words, check if its group is **different from the group of the last selected word**:

     * If yes, add it to the result.
     * If no, skip it.
5. At the end of the iteration, the result will be the **longest possible subsequence** with alternating group values, since we always take the next valid option greedily.

---

### **Why This Works**

* This greedy approach works because:

  * Once you pick a starting group, the only way to extend the alternating sequence is to pick the next element with a **different group**.
  * Skipping elements with the same group does not prevent you from picking future valid options.
  * So, greedily picking the first possible word with a different group guarantees the longest valid sequence.

### **Time and Space Complexity**

* **Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input.
* **Space complexity:** O(n) in the worst case (if all elements alternate and are added to the result).

---

### **Example Walkthrough**

**Input:**
`words = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]`
`groups = [1, 0, 1, 1]`

* Start with `"a"` (group 1)
* `"b"` (group 0) ≠ 1 → add `"b"`
* `"c"` (group 1) ≠ 0 → add `"c"`
* `"d"` (group 1) = 1 → same as previous → skip

Result: `["a", "b", "c"]`

This greedy process ensures the answer is optimal in length, and any such sequence that follows the rule is acceptable.
