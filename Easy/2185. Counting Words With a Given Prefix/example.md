1. **Search Autocomplete**:
   In a search engine, you might want to provide autocomplete suggestions as the user types. You can use the function to count how many words in your database start with the prefix that the user has typed so far.

2. **Tag Filtering**:
   In a blogging platform, you might want to filter tags based on user input. If a user starts typing a tag, you can use the function to count and display how many tags start with the given prefix.

Here is an example of how you might use the function in a search autocomplete scenario:

```javascript
const words = ["apple", "app", "application", "banana", "band", "bandana"];
const prefix = "app";

function countWordsWithPrefix(words, prefix) {
    return words.filter(word => word.startsWith(prefix)).length;
}

const count = countWordsWithPrefix(words, prefix);
console.log(`There are ${count} words that start with "${prefix}".`); // Output: There are 3 words that start with "app".
```

And here is an example for tag filtering:

```javascript
const tags = ["javascript", "java", "json", "jest", "jquery"];
const prefix = "j";

function countTagsWithPrefix(tags, prefix) {
    return tags.filter(tag => tag.startsWith(prefix)).length;
}

const count = countTagsWithPrefix(tags, prefix);
console.log(`There are ${count} tags that start with "${prefix}".`); // Output: There are 5 tags that start with "j"
