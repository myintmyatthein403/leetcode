The approach to solving the problem of counting words with a given prefix involves iterating through the list of words and checking if each word starts with the specified prefix. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Check if the prefix is an empty string or if the list of words is empty. If either condition is true, return 0 immediately as there are no words to count.

2. **Initialize Counter**:
   - Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of words that start with the given prefix.

3. **Iterate Through Words**:
   - Loop through each word in the list of words.
   - For each word, use the `startsWith` method to check if the word starts with the given prefix.

4. **Increment Counter**:
   - If a word starts with the prefix, increment the counter.

5. **Return Result**:
   - After iterating through all the words, return the counter value which represents the number of words that start with the given prefix.

Here is the implementation of the approach:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {string} pref
 * @return {number}
 */
var prefixCount = function (words, pref) {
  // Step 1: Input Validation
  if (pref === '' || words.length == 0) return 0;

  // Step 2: Initialize Counter
  let count = 0;

  // Step 3: Iterate Through Words
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    // Step 4: Increment Counter if Word Starts with Prefix
    if (words[i].startsWith(pref)) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  // Step 5: Return Result
  return count;
};
