### Summary

-   **`moveZeroes`**: Creates a new array, does not modify `nums` in place, and uses additional memory.
-   **`moveZeroesGPT`**: Modifies `nums` in place with constant extra space, meeting the in-place modification requirement and making it more efficient for large arrays.

If in-place modification is a requirement, `moveZeroesGPT` is the correct solution.
