Here are **2 real-world usage examples** and **1 web development example** where a function like `findEvenNumbers` might be useful:

---

### âœ… **Real World Example 1: Lottery Number Generation**

**Context:** A lottery system allows users to enter 3-digit numbers generated from a set of selected digits. The system must:

* Only allow numbers without leading zeros,
* Ensure all entries are even-numbered,
* Prevent duplicate entries.

**Use Case:** After users pick a few digits, the system runs `findEvenNumbers` to generate all valid 3-digit lottery entries they could potentially submit or be matched against.

### âœ… **Real World Example 2: Secure Code Generation for Physical Devices**

**Context:** A hardware lock (like a safe or keypad) requires 3-digit codes.

* The code must be even (e.g., for standardization),
* Cannot start with 0 (leading zeros are invalid on the device display),
* Multiple digits may be reused.

**Use Case:** When a technician enters available digits, the system uses `findEvenNumbers` to generate valid programming codes that can be uploaded to the device.

### ðŸ’» **Web Development Example: Frontend Puzzle Game**

**Context:** You're building a browser-based number puzzle game (e.g., "Digit Builder") where:

* Players drag digits into slots to form 3-digit numbers.
* Only valid numbers (even, no leading zero) count toward their score.

**Use Case:** On the frontend (e.g., in React or Vanilla JS), `findEvenNumbers` is called with the digits a player has selected to compute all valid combinations and:

* Show hints or suggestions,
* Auto-check answers for validity,
* Animate valid combinations on screen.
