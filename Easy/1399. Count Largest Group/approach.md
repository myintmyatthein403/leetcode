To solve this problem, we need to group numbers from `1` to `n` based on the **sum of their digits**, and then determine **how many of these groups are of the largest size**.

### Step-by-step approach:

1. **Group by digit sum:**
   - For each number from `1` to `n`, calculate the **sum of its digits**.
   - Use this sum as a key in a dictionary to count how many numbers fall into that group.

2. **Track group sizes:**
   - Keep track of how many numbers go into each digit sum group. For example, numbers like `1` and `10` both have a digit sum of `1`, so they go into the same group.

3. **Find the largest group size:**
   - After processing all numbers, determine the maximum size among all the groups.

4. **Count how many groups have this maximum size:**
   - Count how many groups have the size equal to the largest group size you found.

### Example for `n = 13`:
- Calculate digit sums:
  - 1 (1), 2 (2), ..., 9 (9)
  - 10 → 1, 11 → 2, 12 → 3, 13 → 4
- Grouping:
  - Sum 1: [1, 10]
  - Sum 2: [2, 11]
  - Sum 3: [3, 12]
  - Sum 4: [4, 13]
  - Others: [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]
- Each of the groups [1,10], [2,11], [3,12], and [4,13] has size 2, which is the largest.
- Therefore, the output is `4`.

This approach ensures clarity and optimal performance since we're only iterating through `n` once.
