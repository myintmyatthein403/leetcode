Alright, let's break down how we can approach this problem.

**Understanding the Problem**

The core task is to find the sum of the XOR totals of every possible subset of a given array `nums`.

* **Subsets:** We need to generate all possible combinations of elements from the input array, including the empty set.
* **XOR Total:** For each subset, we calculate the bitwise XOR of its elements. If a subset is empty, its XOR total is 0.
* **Summation:** Finally, we add up all the calculated XOR totals.

**Approach**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can solve this problem:

1.  **Generate Subsets:**
    * We can use a recursive approach or bit manipulation to generate all possible subsets of the given array `nums`.
    * For an array of length `n`, there will be $2^n$ subsets.

2.  **Calculate XOR Total for Each Subset:**
    * For each subset, we iterate through its elements and calculate the bitwise XOR of those elements.
    * If the subset is empty, the XOR total is 0.

3.  **Sum XOR Totals:**
    * We maintain a running sum of the XOR totals calculated for each subset.
    * After processing all subsets, the running sum will be the final result.

**Conceptual Example**

Let's illustrate with `nums = [1, 3]`:

1.  **Subsets:**
    * [], [1], [3], [1, 3]

2.  **XOR Totals:**
    * []: 0
    * [1]: 1
    * [3]: 3
    * [1, 3]: 1 XOR 3 = 2

3.  **Sum:**
    * 0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6

**Key Concepts**

* **Bitwise XOR (^):** This operation compares corresponding bits of two numbers. If the bits are different, the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
* **Subsets:** A subset is a set containing some or all elements of another set.
* **Recursion or Bit Manipulation:** These techniques are commonly used to generate subsets efficiently.

Let me know if you would like to explore the code for either of these subset creation methods.
