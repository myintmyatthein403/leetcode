The approach used in the provided code snippet to solve the problem of finding substrings within an array of words is as follows:

1. **Initialize an Empty Result Array:**
   - Create an empty array `result` to store the words that are substrings of other words.

2. **Nested Loop to Compare Words:**
   - Use a nested loop to compare each word with every other word in the array.
   - The outer loop iterates through each word using the index `i`.
   - The inner loop iterates through each word using the index `j`.

3. **Check for Substring:**
   - Inside the inner loop, check if the word at index `i` is not the same as the word at index `j` (i.e., `i !== j`).
   - Use the `includes` method to check if the word at index `j` contains the word at index `i`.

4. **Add Substring to Result:**
   - If the word at index `i` is found to be a substring of the word at index `j`, add the word at index `i` to the `result` array.
   - Break out of the inner loop once a match is found to avoid duplicate entries.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - After both loops have completed, return the `result` array containing all the words that are substrings of other words in the array.

Here is the complete code for reference:
```javascript
function findSubstrings(words) {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
      if (i !== j && words[j].includes(words[i])) {
        result.push(words[i]);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

This approach ensures that each word is checked against every other word to determine if it is a substring, and the results are collected in the `result` array.
