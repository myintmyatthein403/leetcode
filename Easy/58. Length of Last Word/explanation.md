### Explanation:

-   **Step 1**: The `trim()` method is used to remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the string `s`. This ensures that if there are spaces at the end of the string, they are ignored.
    
-   **Step 2**: The `lastIndexOf(' ')` method is used to find the index of the last space in the trimmed string. If there's no space in the string, `lastIndexOf` returns `-1`, meaning the entire string is a single word.
    
-   **Step 3**: The length of the last word is calculated by subtracting the index of the last space from the total length of the string, and then subtracting one more to account for the fact that indices start at zero.
    

### Example Walkthrough:

1.  **Example 1**:
    
    -   Input: `"Hello World"`
    -   After trimming: `"Hello World"`
    -   Last space index: `5`
    -   Length of last word: `11 - 5 - 1 = 5`
    -   **Output**: `5`
2.  **Example 2**:
    
    -   Input: `" fly me to the moon "`
    -   After trimming: `"fly me to the moon"`
    -   Last space index: `18`
    -   Length of last word: `22 - 18 - 1 = 4`
    -   **Output**: `4`
3.  **Example 3**:
    
    -   Input: `"luffy is still joyboy"`
    -   After trimming: `"luffy is still joyboy"`
    -   Last space index: `17`
    -   Length of last word: `21 - 17 - 1 = 4`
    -   **Output**: `6`

This solution efficiently finds the length of the last word in `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the length of the string, by scanning the string once.
