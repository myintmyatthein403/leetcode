Absolutely! Let's break down the approach to solve this problem.

**Understanding the Problem**

The core requirement is to determine if we can group all the numbers in the input array `nums` into pairs where each pair contains two identical numbers. This implies that:

1.  **Even Number of Elements:** The array `nums` must have an even number of elements. If it doesn't, it's impossible to form pairs.
2.  **Frequency Counts:** Each unique number in `nums` must appear an even number of times. If any number has an odd frequency, it cannot be paired.

**Approach**

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1.  **Check for Even Length:**
    * First, verify if the length of the `nums` array is even. If `nums.length` is odd, immediately return `false` because you can't divide an odd number of elements into pairs.

2.  **Count Frequencies:**
    * Use a data structure (like a hash map or dictionary) to count the frequency of each number in the `nums` array.
    * Iterate through `nums` and for each number:
        * If the number is already in the map, increment its count.
        * Otherwise, add the number to the map with a count of 1.

3.  **Check for Even Frequencies:**
    * Iterate through the frequency counts stored in the map.
    * For each number's count:
        * If the count is odd, return `false` because that number cannot be paired.
    * If all counts are even, return `true`.

**Explanation with Examples**

* **Example 1: `nums = [3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2]`**
    1.  `nums.length` is 6, which is even.
    2.  Frequency counts:
        * 3: 2
        * 2: 4
    3.  Both frequencies (2 and 4) are even. Therefore, return `true`.

* **Example 2: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`**
    1.  `nums.length` is 4, which is even.
    2.  Frequency counts:
        * 1: 1
        * 2: 1
        * 3: 1
        * 4: 1
    3.  All frequencies are 1, which is odd. Therefore, return `false`.

**In essence, the solution revolves around ensuring that every unique number in the array appears an even number of times, making it possible to pair them up.**
