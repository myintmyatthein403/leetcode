### Approach:

1.  **Use a Stack**:
    
    -   Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets as you encounter them in the string.
    -   For every closing bracket, check if it corresponds to the last opened bracket (i.e., the top of the stack).
2.  **Steps**:
    
    -   Traverse through each character in the string `s`.
    -   If you encounter an opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`), push it onto the stack.
    -   If you encounter a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`):
        -   Check if the stack is empty (if so, the string is invalid because there's no corresponding opening bracket).
        -   Pop the top of the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket.
        -   If it doesnâ€™t match, the string is invalid.
    -   After the loop, if the stack is empty, all brackets were properly matched and closed, so the string is valid. If the stack is not empty, some opening brackets were not closed, so the string is invalid.
3.  **Edge Case**: If the string is empty, it's considered valid because there are no unmatched brackets.
