### Approach:

1.  **Edge Cases**: Handle the scenario where the input array is empty or contains only one string.
2.  **Initialize the Prefix**: Start with the first string in the array as a potential common prefix.
3.  **Compare Each String**: Compare the prefix with each subsequent string and shorten the prefix as needed.
4.  **Return the Result**: If the prefix becomes empty at any point, return an empty string. Otherwise, return the longest common prefix found.
