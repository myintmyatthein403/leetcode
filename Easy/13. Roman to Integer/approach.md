### Approach:

1.  **Mapping Roman Symbols to Values**: Create a mapping of each Roman numeral symbol to its corresponding integer value.
2.  **Iterate through the String**: Loop through each character in the string and check its value against the next character.
3.  **Handle Subtraction Cases**: If the current character is less than the next one, subtract its value; otherwise, add it.
