Here are **2 real-world usage examples** and **1 web development example** where detecting three consecutive odd numbers (or a similar pattern) could be useful:

### ✅ **Real-World Examples**

#### 1. **Monitoring Sensor Data for Anomaly Detection**

Imagine a smart agriculture system that monitors soil moisture levels. Odd-numbered readings could indicate faulty sensor data (e.g., due to noise or external interference). If **three consecutive odd readings** are detected, the system could trigger a warning or flag the sensor for maintenance.

> 💡 *Use Case:* If readings like `[12, 15, 17, 19, 8]` are received, and `15, 17, 19` are odd, the system can detect potential abnormality.

#### 2. **Gaming – Combo Detection in Scores or Actions**

In a game, players may get a bonus or unlock a power-up if they perform an action (e.g., land on an odd-numbered tile or score an odd-numbered point) **three times in a row**.

> 💡 *Use Case:* `[2, 3, 5, 7]` — if `3, 5, 7` are actions that land on odd-numbered tiles, trigger a combo reward.

### 🌐 **Web Development Example**

#### 3. **User Interaction Analysis**

On an analytics dashboard, you may want to track **unusual behavior patterns**—like a user clicking on three odd-numbered product IDs in a row (e.g., products with IDs `101, 103, 105`). This might signal a specific browsing pattern or interest that can trigger personalized recommendations.

> 💡 *Use Case:* If a user clicks on product IDs `[202, 101, 103, 105, 200]`, the backend can detect `101, 103, 105` as a pattern and adapt product suggestions accordingly.
