## âœ… Real-World, Web, and Software Development Use Cases

Hereâ€™s how this simplified logic **can be useful in practical scenarios**:

---

### 1. **User Activity Scoring**

**Scenario**: A platform wants to reward users based on unique positive actions (likes, shares, posts, etc.), each with a point value.

* You avoid duplicate actions (e.g., same user liking twice).
* You ignore negative or neutral scores.

ðŸ§  This function helps by summing unique positive contributions.

---

### 2. **E-Commerce Recommendation Engine**

**Scenario**: Given a list of recent user transactions (profits/losses), compute the net gain from **distinct** profitable items.

* Ignore duplicates and negative revenue products.
* Use this to recommend top-selling profitable items.

---

### 3. **Game or Points System**

**Scenario**: In a game, players gain or lose points. You want to show their **best possible score** by picking only distinct **positive** achievements.

* Negative events are ignored.
* Repeated rewards are counted once.

---

### 4. **Analytics & Reporting**

**Scenario**: Filter logs of system metrics, financial data, or app performance.

* Eliminate duplicates (using `Set`).
* Focus only on **positive trends** (e.g., increased usage, gains).
* Get the **sum of unique improvements**.

---

### 5. **Front-End Filtering Logic**

**Scenario**: In a dashboard showing user stats (e.g., unique items added to cart with positive price), calculate the total cart value while avoiding duplicates.

* Filters negative-priced items (bugs or promotions).
* Summarizes real value added.

---

### 6. **Data Cleanup Scripts**

**Scenario**: Cleanup scripts in ETL pipelines might need to:

* Remove duplicates.
* Drop invalid (negative) values.
* Aggregate results simply.

This function fits as a simple transformation utility.
