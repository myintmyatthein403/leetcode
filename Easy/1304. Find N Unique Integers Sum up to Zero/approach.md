To solve the problem **"1304. Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero"**, let's break it down and think through an **efficient approach (no code)**.

---

### ✅ **Goal**

Given an integer `n`, return **any array** of `n` **unique integers** such that their **sum is zero**.

---

### ✅ **Key Observations**

1. **Zero is neutral** — it's the only integer that doesn’t affect the sum when added.
2. **Pairs of numbers cancel each other out** — for example, `-3 + 3 = 0`, `-1 + 1 = 0`, etc.
3. If we can construct symmetric pairs like `(-x, x)`, we ensure the sum is zero and values are unique.

---

### ✅ **Strategy / Approach**

There are two cases to consider based on whether `n` is even or odd:

---

#### **Case 1: n is even**

* We can form `n / 2` symmetric **pairs** like:

  ```
  (-1, 1), (-2, 2), (-3, 3), ...
  ```
* All numbers are **unique** and come in pairs that sum to 0.
* Total sum = 0, and we have exactly `n` numbers.

---

#### **Case 2: n is odd**

* Same as even case, but we need to add **0** as a standalone number to make the count odd.
* So we do:

  * Include 0
  * Add `(n - 1)/2` symmetric pairs:

    ```
    0, (-1, 1), (-2, 2), ...
    ```
* Again, all are unique, and sum = 0.

---

### ✅ **Why This Works**

* All numbers are unique (no repeats).
* The sum of symmetric pairs is zero.
* Including 0 (when `n` is odd) keeps the sum balanced.
* Construction is simple and guarantees a valid output.

---

### ✅ **Example Walkthrough**

#### n = 5 (odd)

* Pairs: (-2, 2), (-1, 1)
* Add 0
* Output: `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`

#### n = 4 (even)

* Pairs: (-2, 2), (-1, 1)
* Output: `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`

---

### ✅ **Time and Space Complexity**

* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(n)

We generate `n` elements directly, so both time and space are linear in `n`.
