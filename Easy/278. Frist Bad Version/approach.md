To solve the problem of finding the first bad version, you can use a binary search approach to minimize the number of calls to the `isBadVersion` API. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to 1 and `n` respectively.
2. Perform a binary search:
   - Calculate the middle point `mid` as `left + (right - left) / 2`.
   - If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `true`, it means the bad version is at `mid` or before `mid`. So, update `right` to `mid`.
   - If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `false`, it means the bad version is after `mid`. So, update `left` to `mid + 1`.
3. Continue the binary search until `left` equals `right`.
4. The value of `left` (or `right`) will be the first bad version.

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def firstBadVersion(n):
    left, right = 1, n
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if isBadVersion(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```

This approach ensures that you minimize the number of calls to the `isBadVersion` API by effectively halving the search space with each iteration.
