The binary search approach is used to minimize the number of calls to the `isBadVersion` API because it efficiently narrows down the search space by half in each iteration. Here's why this approach is effective:

1. **Efficiency**: Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which is much more efficient than a linear search with a time complexity of O(n). This means that even for large values of `n`, the number of API calls will be relatively small.

2. **Minimizing API Calls**: By checking the middle version (`mid`) and adjusting the search range based on whether `mid` is a bad version or not, you reduce the number of versions you need to check. This directly minimizes the number of calls to the `isBadVersion` API.

3. **Guaranteed Correctness**: The binary search ensures that you will find the first bad version because it systematically narrows down the range until `left` equals `right`, which will be the first bad version.

In summary, the binary search approach is chosen because it is both efficient and effective in minimizing the number of API calls while guaranteeing the correct result
