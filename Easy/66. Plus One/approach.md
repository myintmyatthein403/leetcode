To solve the problem of incrementing a large integer represented as an array of digits, we need to consider the following steps:

### Steps:

1.  **Start from the Rightmost Digit**: Begin with the least significant digit (i.e., the last element in the array) since this is where the addition of `1` will initially occur.
    
2.  **Handle the Addition**:
    
    -   If the digit is less than `9`, simply increment the digit by `1` and return the array.
    -   If the digit is `9`, change it to `0` and move to the next digit on the left because adding `1` to `9` results in `10`, which causes a carryover.
3.  **Handle the Carry**:
    
    -   If you reach the most significant digit and it was `9` (after all digits to the right have been converted to `0`), you will need to insert `1` at the beginning of the array. This handles cases like `[9, 9, 9]` becoming `[1, 0, 0, 0]`.
