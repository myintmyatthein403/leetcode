To solve this problem, the goal is to **count how many numbers in the given array have an even number of digits**.

### Step-by-step approach:

1. **Iterate through each number in the array**:
   - You need to examine each number one by one.

2. **Determine the number of digits in each number**:
   - This can be done by converting the number to a string and checking the length of that string.
   - For example, converting `12` to a string gives `"12"`, which has length `2` (even).

3. **Check if the number of digits is even**:
   - Use a modulo operation: if `number_of_digits % 2 == 0`, then it's even.

4. **Keep a count**:
   - Every time you find a number with an even number of digits, increment a counter.

5. **Return the final count**:
   - After going through all numbers, return the counter value.

This approach is simple and efficient for the size of typical input arrays. The core logic is based on **counting digits** and checking **evenness**.
