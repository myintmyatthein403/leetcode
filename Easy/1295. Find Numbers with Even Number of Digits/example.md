Here are **2 real-world examples** and **1 web development example** where counting digits (especially even-numbered ones) can be useful:

---

### âœ… **Real-World Example 1: Secure PIN Filtering**
**Use Case:**  
A banking system may enforce that users only use PIN codes with **even number of digits** for added complexity or compatibility with encryption algorithms.

**Example:**  
When analyzing a list of user-set PINs, the system may count how many conform to the even-digit rule to flag or enforce a policy update.

### âœ… **Real-World Example 2: Number Plate Analysis**
**Use Case:**  
In vehicle registration systems, even-digit number plates might be allowed on certain days for traffic control (e.g., alternate day driving rules).

**Example:**  
An authority may analyze a list of license plates to count how many have even digit counts and schedule traffic accordingly.

### ðŸ’» **Web Development Example: Mobile Number Validation in Forms**
**Use Case:**  
In an online form (e.g., user sign-up or checkout), you might require users to enter phone numbers with an even number of digits (e.g., country-specific formats).

**Example:**  
A JavaScript function on the frontend can scan inputted numbers and count how many are valid (i.e., have even digits), and show an error message or filter the data before submission.
