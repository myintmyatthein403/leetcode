Here are two real-world examples where finding the maximum ascending subarray sum can be useful:

### Example 1: Stock Price Analysis
Imagine you are analyzing the stock prices of a company over a period of time. You have an array where each element represents the stock price on a particular day. You want to find the maximum profit you could have made by buying and selling the stock on consecutive days where the prices are strictly increasing.

```javascript
const stockPrices = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695];
const maxProfit = maxAscendingSum(stockPrices);
console.log(maxProfit); // Output: 655 (from buying at 40 and selling at 695)
```

### Example 2: Temperature Trends
Suppose you are a meteorologist and you have recorded the daily temperatures over a month. You want to find the longest period of consecutive days where the temperature was strictly increasing and calculate the total temperature increase over that period.

```javascript
const temperatures = [30, 32, 35, 40, 38, 42, 45, 50, 48, 55];
const maxTemperatureIncrease = maxAscendingSum(temperatures);
console.log(maxTemperatureIncrease); // Output: 75 (from 30 to 50)
```

In both examples, the `maxAscendingSum` function helps to identify the maximum sum of an ascending subarray, which can be interpreted as the maximum profit in stock prices or the maximum temperature increase over consecutive days.
