### **Real-World Use Cases for Merging Sorted Lists by ID**  

#### **1. Merging Sales Data from Multiple Stores**  
- **Scenario:** A retail company collects sales data from different branches. Each branch reports sales in a sorted list format:  
  - `store1_sales = [[101, 500], [102, 300], [104, 700]]`  
  - `store2_sales = [[101, 400], [103, 250], [104, 300]]`  
- **Goal:** Merge the sales data by product ID, summing up the values where IDs match.  
- **Result:**  
  ```js
  [[101, 900], [102, 300], [103, 250], [104, 1000]]
  ```
- **Why?**  
  - Helps in calculating total revenue per product across all branches.
  - Useful for inventory restocking decisions.

#### **2. Aggregating User Activity from Multiple Platforms**  
- **Scenario:** A company tracks user engagement (likes, shares, comments) from different platforms (Website, Mobile App). Each platform logs engagement separately.  
  - `web_activity = [[1, 50], [2, 30], [4, 70]]`  
  - `mobile_activity = [[1, 40], [3, 25], [4, 20]]`  
- **Goal:** Merge both datasets by user ID, summing up interactions.  
- **Result:**  
  ```js
  [[1, 90], [2, 30], [3, 25], [4, 90]]
  ```
- **Why?**  
  - Provides a **unified view** of user engagement.
  - Helps in **personalized marketing** by analyzing total activity.

These examples show how merging sorted data efficiently helps businesses make data-driven decisions. ðŸš€
