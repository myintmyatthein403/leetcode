### **Comparison of Both Approaches**  

| Approach | Two-Pointer Approach | HashMap Approach |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Time Complexity** | **O(m + n)** (Linear) | **O(m + n + k log k)** (HashMap + Sorting) |
| **Space Complexity** | **O(m + n)** (Stores result array) | **O(k)** (HashMap stores unique IDs) |
| **Sorting Requirement** | **Not Needed** (Maintains order naturally) | **Sorting Needed** (After HashMap processing) |
| **Best for** | **When both arrays are already sorted** | **Unsorted input or quick lookups** |
| **Efficiency** | **Faster when inputs are sorted** | **Can be slower due to sorting at the end** |
| **Readability** | Slightly more complex but efficient | Simpler but requires additional sorting |

### **Key Observations**
1. **Two-Pointer Approach:**
   - Works optimally when **both input arrays are sorted**.
   - Uses **O(m + n) time**, **avoiding extra sorting**.
   - Traverses both lists only **once**, making it **fast and efficient**.

2. **HashMap Approach:**
   - Uses a **Map** to store `id â†’ value` pairs.
   - **Handles unsorted input well** but requires **O(k log k) sorting** at the end.
   - Slightly **simpler code**, but **less efficient** when dealing with already sorted arrays.

### **Which One to Choose?**
- **If inputs are sorted:** âœ… **Two-pointer approach is best** (O(m + n)).
- **If inputs are unsorted:** âœ… **HashMap approach works well** (O(m + n + k log k)) but requires sorting.
- **For large datasets:** âœ… **Two-pointer approach** is **more memory efficient** (no extra Map storage).  

**Final Verdict:** If the problem guarantees **sorted inputs**, stick with the **two-pointer approach** for optimal performance. ðŸš€
