### **Approach Explanation**

The goal is to merge two sorted 2D integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, based on their unique `id` values, summing up values for matching `id`s and ensuring the final result remains sorted.

---

### **Key Observations**
1. **Both Arrays Are Sorted**  
   - Since `nums1` and `nums2` are already sorted by `id`, we can leverage a two-pointer approach to efficiently merge them.

2. **Unique IDs**  
   - Each array contains unique IDs, meaning that within a single array, no `id` appears more than once.

3. **Sum Values for Matching IDs**  
   - If an `id` exists in both arrays, sum their values.
   - If an `id` exists only in one array, include it with its respective value.

4. **Maintain Sorted Order**  
   - Since both arrays are sorted, merging while maintaining order is straightforward.

### **Approach**
#### **1. Two-Pointer Technique**
- Use two pointers, `i` (for `nums1`) and `j` (for `nums2`), to iterate through both arrays simultaneously.
- Compare the `id`s at `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`:
  - If `nums1[i][0] == nums2[j][0]`, sum the values and add to the result.
  - If `nums1[i][0] < nums2[j][0]`, add `nums1[i]` to the result and move `i` forward.
  - If `nums1[i][0] > nums2[j][0]`, add `nums2[j]` to the result and move `j` forward.
- Continue until one array is fully processed, then add the remaining elements from the other array.

#### **2. Alternative Approach: HashMap**
- Use a dictionary (hashmap) to store `id` as the key and sum up values while iterating through both arrays.
- Convert the dictionary back to a sorted list based on `id`.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Two-Pointer Approach:** \(O(m + n)\) (since we iterate through both arrays once)
- **HashMap Approach:** \(O(m + n)\) for inserting, then \(O(k \log k)\) for sorting (where \(k\) is the number of unique ids). This may be slower than the two-pointer approach.

---

### **Conclusion**
- The **two-pointer approach** is optimal when both arrays are sorted, as it ensures an efficient linear traversal.
- The **hashmap approach** is useful when dealing with unsorted data or when quick lookups are needed.
