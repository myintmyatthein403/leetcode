Great question! Converting binary numbers to decimal—like in LeetCode #1290—is a fundamental operation with many **real-world applications** in **web development**, **software engineering**, and **system design**. Here's how and where it’s commonly used:

---

## 🧑‍💻 1. **Bit Manipulation in Web & Software Development**

### ✅ Example: **User Permissions & Feature Flags**

Many systems represent permissions as **binary flags**:

```js
// Example: 3-bit permission - 101 means [Read, No Write, Execute]
const permissionBits = [1, 0, 1]; // Convert to decimal: 5
```

* In code, it’s more efficient to store this as an **integer (e.g., 5)** than as an array or object.
* When reading from databases or APIs, converting binary to decimal (and vice versa) is often needed.

## 🌐 2. **Networking and IP Addressing**

### ✅ Example: **IPv4 Address Parsing**

Each segment of an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) is internally stored in binary. Web servers and routers often:

* Convert IP addresses from human-readable format to **binary or decimal** for routing and subnet masking.
* Use similar logic to your function: reading binary segments and converting them to decimal integers.

## 📱 3. **Frontend Development: Binary-Driven UI Logic**

### ✅ Example: **Toggle States with Binary Flags**

Imagine a UI component like a table where:

* Bit `0`: Show header
* Bit `1`: Enable sorting
* Bit `2`: Enable filtering

A developer may store and pass a flag like `101` (binary) which means:

* Header ✅
* Sorting ❌
* Filtering ✅

To apply logic in JavaScript, you'd convert it to `5` (decimal), then check flags with bitwise operations.

## 🎮 4. **Game Development**

Games use binary and bitwise operations to manage:

* Character states (e.g., isRunning, isJumping, isInvincible)
* Collision masks
* Inventory slots

Converting linked list binary inputs into integers is conceptually similar to how games store and interpret state in memory.

## 🔐 5. **Security: Hashing & Encryption**

Low-level cryptographic operations manipulate binary data.

* Hash algorithms often transform data into **binary streams** before digesting them.
* Understanding how to work with binary data and convert it into numeric formats is fundamental in security-related code.

## 🔢 6. **Low-Level Hardware and Embedded Systems**

While not strictly web, in systems that interact with hardware (IoT, embedded devices), binary representations of sensor data, instructions, or memory need to be decoded into human-readable values.
