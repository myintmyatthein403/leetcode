Alright, let‚Äôs carefully build the **approach** step by step:

### üîë Key Insights

1. Each rectangle is defined by `(length, width)`.
2. The diagonal of a rectangle can be calculated with the **Pythagorean theorem**:

   $$
   diagonal = \sqrt{length^2 + width^2}
   $$
3. To compare diagonals, we don‚Äôt need to compute the square root (which can introduce floating-point precision). Instead, we can compare **squared diagonals**:

   $$
   diagonal^2 = length^2 + width^2
   $$
4. If two rectangles have the same diagonal, we choose the one with the **larger area**:

   $$
   area = length \times width
   $$

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Initialize tracking variables**:

   * `maxDiagonalSquared` ‚Üí keep track of the largest diagonal squared found so far.
   * `maxArea` ‚Üí area of the rectangle corresponding to that diagonal.

2. **Iterate over each rectangle**:

   * Compute `dSquared = length^2 + width^2`.
   * Compute `area = length * width`.

3. **Compare and update**:

   * If `dSquared > maxDiagonalSquared`:

     * Update `maxDiagonalSquared = dSquared`
     * Update `maxArea = area`
   * Else if `dSquared == maxDiagonalSquared`:

     * Update `maxArea = max(maxArea, area)` (to ensure the maximum area for equal diagonals).

4. **Final Result**:

   * After processing all rectangles, return `maxArea`.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**:
  $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rectangles (just one pass).
* **Space Complexity**:
  $O(1)$, we only store a few variables for comparisons.

‚úÖ This way, we efficiently find the rectangle with the **longest diagonal** and return the **maximum area** if there‚Äôs a tie.
