### Explanation:

-   **Example 1**:
    
    -   Input: `nums = [1,1,2]`
    -   The function will return `k = 2` and the first two elements of `nums` will be `[1, 2]`.
-   **Example 2**:
    
    -   Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]`
    -   The function will return `k = 5` and the first five elements of `nums` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

### Time Complexity:

-   The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array since it only requires one pass through the array.

### Space Complexity:

-   The space complexity is O(1) because it modifies the array in place and uses only a constant amount of extra space.
