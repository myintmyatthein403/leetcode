### Approach:

1.  **Two Pointers**:
    
    -   Use a slow pointer (`i`) to keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.
    -   Use a fast pointer (`j`) to traverse the array and find unique elements.
2.  **Traversal**:
    
    -   Start with both pointers at the beginning of the array.
    -   Compare the current element at the fast pointer (`j`) with the element at the slow pointer (`i`).
    -   If they are different, increment the slow pointer and copy the value from the fast pointer to the slow pointer position.
    -   Continue this process until you have traversed the entire array.
3.  **Return Value**:
    
    -   The slow pointer (`i`) will end at the position of the last unique element, so the length of the unique elements is `i + 1`.
