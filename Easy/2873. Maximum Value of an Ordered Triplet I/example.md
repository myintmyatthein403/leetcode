### **Real-World Applications**

#### **1. Stock Market Trading (Maximize Profit)**
- **Scenario:** A trader wants to maximize their profit by identifying three key price points in a stock's price history:
  - **Buy price (`nums[i]`)** â†’ The highest price before a drop.
  - **Drop price (`nums[j]`)** â†’ A local minimum before a surge.
  - **Sell price (`nums[k]`)** â†’ The highest price after the drop.
- **Application:**  
  - Using this function, traders can analyze past price trends and determine the best possible triplet to optimize their trade.

#### **2. Product Discount Analysis (Retail Pricing)**
- **Scenario:** A retail store wants to analyze past pricing trends to determine how discounts impact sales.
  - **Original price (`nums[i]`)** â†’ The highest price before a discount.
  - **Discounted price (`nums[j]`)** â†’ A temporary price reduction.
  - **Rebound price (`nums[k]`)** â†’ A higher price after the sale.
- **Application:**  
  - This algorithm helps identify pricing strategies that maximize revenue by leveraging historical pricing data.

These use cases demonstrate how the logic of maximizing a triplet value can be applied to financial and retail sectors for decision-making! ðŸš€
