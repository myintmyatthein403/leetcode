Here are **two real-world examples** and **one web development example** of how the logic of `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]` (i.e., indirect indexing or mapping) could be applied:

---

### ‚úÖ Real-World Example 1: **Airport Baggage Transfer System**

Imagine a baggage routing system in an airport:

* `nums[i]` represents which conveyor belt your luggage is sent to.
* `nums[nums[i]]` gives you the final gate/terminal that belt routes luggage to.

**Use case:** To build a final list showing where each passenger‚Äôs bag will end up without manually tracing every step.

---

### ‚úÖ Real-World Example 2: **Multi-Hop Package Delivery (Logistics Chain)**

In a logistics network:

* Each warehouse forwards a package to the next one (`nums[i]` = next warehouse index).
* You want to know the **second hop destination** or final delivery hub via two levels: `nums[nums[i]]`.

**Use case:** Precomputing final destinations for optimization or tracking systems.

### üåê Web Development Example: **User Role Resolution from Nested Mappings**

In a web app:

* `nums[i]` might be the ID of a **role** assigned to a user.
* `nums[nums[i]]` could map that role to its **default permission set** or **dashboard layout**.

**Use case:** You want to generate a user's dashboard by looking up the permission/dashboard template tied to their role ID.
