To solve the problem **"3330. Find the Original Typed String I"**, the key is to recognize that **Alice might have held one key too long at most once**. That means, in the final string `word`, **at most one group of consecutive characters could have been a result of a key being held** (i.e., one group is **longer than originally intended**).

---

### **Approach Overview (No Code)**

#### **Step 1: Understand the structure of the word**

The given string `word` consists of characters that may include one *extra-long* group due to a held key. All other characters must be typed normally (i.e., no unintended repetition). So we want to find **how many ways we can "compress" the string once**, and still get a valid original string.

#### **Step 2: Group consecutive characters**

Group the input string into **segments of consecutive identical characters**. For example:

* `"abbcccc"` → `["a", "bb", "cccc"]`
* `"aaaa"` → `["aaaa"]`
* `"abcd"` → `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`

#### **Step 3: For each group, determine possible reductions**

Each group has a number of ways to represent the *original* character(s):

* If Alice held a key too long in this group, she may have typed **more than one** of the character. We can try reducing the group **one by one** down to 1, and each possible reduction counts as a different possible original string (as long as only one group was altered).
* Example: `"cccc"` → possible original versions: `"c"`, `"cc"`, `"ccc"`, `"cccc"` → **4 choices**.

But since **only one group** could be affected, we can only apply this "shortening" to one group. All other groups must remain as-is.

#### **Step 4: Count valid original strings**

* For each group with length ≥ 2, we compute **how many shorter versions we could have used if this group were the "held-key" group**, while leaving all other groups untouched.
* We sum the number of such valid variations across all such groups (since we’re only allowed to change one group).
* Finally, we add **1 more** to the count to account for the case where **Alice didn’t make any mistake at all**, i.e., the original string was exactly the same as the input.

---

### **Summary of Logic**

1. Split the word into character groups.
2. For each group with length > 1:

   * Compute how many **shorter versions** we can create by reducing its length (from current length down to 1).
   * Each reduced version is a potential original string.
3. Add 1 for the case where **no key was held too long**.

---

### **Examples**

* `"abbcccc"` → groups: `["a", "bb", "cccc"]`

  * `"bb"` → possible original: `"b"` → 1 extra option
  * `"cccc"` → original: `"c"`, `"cc"`, `"ccc"` → 3 extra options
  * Total = 1 (no error) + 1 (shorten bb) + 3 (shorten cccc) = **5**

* `"abcd"` → no repeated groups → only 1 possible original string (no key was held) → **1**

* `"aaaa"` → group: `"aaaa"` → possible original: `"a"`, `"aa"`, `"aaa"`, `"aaaa"` → **4**

---

This strategy ensures we respect the constraint that **only one group may have been affected**, and gives us the total number of original strings Alice might have intended to type.
