Here are two real-world examples where finding the longest strictly increasing or decreasing subarray can be useful:

1. **Stock Market Analysis**:
   - **Scenario**: Analyzing stock prices to identify trends.
   - **Usage**: You have a list of daily closing prices of a stock. By finding the longest strictly increasing subarray, you can identify the longest period during which the stock price continuously increased. Similarly, finding the longest strictly decreasing subarray helps identify the longest period of continuous decline. This information can be useful for making investment decisions or understanding market behavior.

2. **Weather Data Analysis**:
   - **Scenario**: Analyzing temperature data to identify climate patterns.
   - **Usage**: You have a list of daily temperatures recorded over a period of time. By finding the longest strictly increasing subarray, you can identify the longest period of continuous temperature rise, which might indicate a heatwave. Conversely, finding the longest strictly decreasing subarray can help identify the longest period of continuous temperature drop, which might indicate a cold spell. This analysis can be useful for meteorologists and researchers studying climate change.
