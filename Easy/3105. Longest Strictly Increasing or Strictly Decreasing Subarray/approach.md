Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Create two variables `max_len` and `current_len` to keep track of the maximum length of the subarray and the current length of the subarray being evaluated, respectively.
   - Initialize `max_len` to 1 (since the smallest subarray has at least one element) and `current_len` to 1.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Loop through the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the end.

3. **Check for Increasing or Decreasing Subarray**:
   - For each element, compare it with the previous element.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous element, it means the subarray is increasing.
   - If the current element is less than the previous element, it means the subarray is decreasing.
   - If the current element is equal to the previous element, reset `current_len` to 1 because the subarray is neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing.

4. **Update Current Length**:
   - If the subarray is either increasing or decreasing, increment `current_len` by 1.

5. **Update Maximum Length**:
   - After updating `current_len`, compare it with `max_len`.
   - If `current_len` is greater than `max_len`, update `max_len` with the value of `current_len`.

6. **Reset Current Length**:
   - If the subarray is neither increasing nor decreasing, reset `current_len` to 1.

7. **Return Result**:
   - After the loop ends, `max_len` will contain the length of the longest strictly increasing or strictly decreasing subarray.
   - Return `max_len`.

This approach ensures that you traverse the array only once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).
