To solve **Leetcode 3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I**, let’s break down the **core idea and approach** without writing code.

---

### 🔁 Game Rule Recap:

Start with:

* `word = "a"`

Each **operation** does the following:

* For each character `c` in the current `word`, generate its **next character** in the alphabet (`'z'` wraps to `'a'`)
* Append this new string to the **end** of the current `word`

This makes the string grow exponentially.

---

### 📊 Observation:

Let's simulate a few steps:

**Step 0** (initial):
`word = "a"`

**Step 1**:

* Next chars: `"b"`
* `word = "a" + "b" = "ab"`

**Step 2**:

* Next chars: `"bc"` (from "ab")
* `word = "ab" + "bc" = "abbc"`

**Step 3**:

* Next chars: `"bccd"` (from "abbc")
* `word = "abbc" + "bccd" = "abbcbccd"`

And so on...

---

### 📈 Pattern:

Each time, the **new string** appended is generated from the current word:

* So after each operation, the new string doubles roughly in size.

This is very similar to **Fibonacci-like growth** in terms of size, because each new part is based on the old part.

---

### 💡 Key Insight:

We **don’t need to build the whole string up to length `k`**, which would be inefficient.

Instead, use a **reverse approach**:

If we know `k`, we can **trace back** to find which position in which version of the string the `k-th` character came from:

* Because every new character is derived from a previous character +1
* So we can walk backwards: if `k > length of original part`, it came from the derived part → map it back

We continue doing this until `k` points to the original `'a'`

---

### 🧠 Strategy:

1. **Track the size** of the `word` after each step until it reaches or exceeds `k`
2. **Walk backward** from that version, reducing `k` as needed:

   * If `k` points to the derived part, find the corresponding index in the original and subtract one alphabetically
   * If `k` points to the original part, keep going back until you reach base case

This uses a **recursive** or iterative reduction approach, not string construction.

---

### ✅ Why This Works:

* The operation is deterministic and reversible
* Characters evolve in a **predictable** pattern
* You avoid memory/time blowup by not actually building the long string

Let me know if you'd like this logic converted into clean code or walked through with a specific `k`.
