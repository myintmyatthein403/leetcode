Here are **real-world examples** of how a function like `findWordsContaining(words, x)` can be practically used:

## üñ•Ô∏è **Software Development Examples**

### **1. Spell Checker / Search Assistant**

* **Scenario**: In a word processor (like Microsoft Word or Google Docs), a feature highlights all words that contain a specific character (e.g., to identify commonly mistyped letters like `z` or `q`).
* **Use**: Find all words in a document that contain a rare or user-searched character for suggestions, corrections, or analysis.

```text
If a user types: "Highlight all words that contain 'z'", the function finds indices in the text like ["amazing", "zebra", "buzz"].
```

### **2. Log File Analyzer**

* **Scenario**: You're analyzing server logs and want to locate all log entries that contain a certain character or token (e.g., `E` for error, `W` for warning).
* **Use**: This can be used to identify the index or line number of entries that contain a specific character or keyword.

```text
Input: lines of log messages, search for logs containing 'E' to find all error messages.
```

## üåê **Web Development Example**

### **3. Live Search Filter (Client-Side UI Filtering)**

* **Scenario**: A user types a character into a search box on a website, and you need to filter a list of words or product names that include that character.
* **Use**: Implementing live filtering of items as the user types.

```text
User types "a" ‚Üí You show all product titles containing "a", by finding their indices in the data array.
```

This improves user experience by allowing **dynamic searching or highlighting** in real-time on the client side.

These examples show how even a simple character-searching function can support powerful features like filtering, diagnostics, and interactive UI behavior in real-world systems.
