1. Check if the lengths of the two strings `s1` and `s2` are different. If they are, return `false` because they cannot be made equal with one swap.
2. Check if the two strings are already equal. If they are, return `true` because no swap is needed.
3. Initialize an empty array `diff` to store the indices where the characters of `s1` and `s2` differ.
4. Iterate through the characters of the strings:
   - For each character, compare the characters at the same position in `s1` and `s2`.
   - If the characters are different, add the index to the `diff` array.
5. After the loop, check if the length of the `diff` array is not equal to 2. If it is not, return `false` because more than one swap or no swap cannot make the strings equal.
6. Finally, check if swapping the characters at the indices stored in `diff` makes the strings equal:
   - Return `true` if `s1[diff[0]]` is equal to `s2[diff[1]]` and `s1[diff[1]]` is equal to `s2[diff[0]]`.
   - Otherwise, return `false`.
