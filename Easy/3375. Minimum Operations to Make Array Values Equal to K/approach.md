To solve this problem, the goal is to **reduce all elements in the array `nums` to the target value `k`** using a special operation that only allows reductions **via valid integers `h`**. Here's how to approach it:

---

### üîç Understanding the Operation
You're allowed to pick a valid `h` and then **replace every number in `nums` that is greater than `h` with `h`**.  
An integer `h` is **valid** if **all values strictly greater than `h` in `nums` are the same**.

So if we want to perform an operation at some point with `h = 4`, that means:
- All numbers greater than 4 in the current `nums` must be the same (e.g., all 5s).

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Strategy

#### 1. **Check if it's even possible**
If **any element in `nums` is less than `k`**, then it is **impossible** to make all values equal to `k`, because we can only reduce values‚Äînot increase them.

#### 2. **Work from high to low**
Since we're reducing numbers toward `k`, we can:
- Start from the **maximum value** in `nums`.
- At each step, try to find a **valid value `h`** that is lower than the current max but **greater than or equal to `k`**.
- Once a valid `h` is found, perform the reduction operation.
- Repeat until the array contains only `k`.

#### 3. **Track operations**
Count how many valid reductions it takes until the entire array becomes `[k, k, ..., k]`.

---

### üí° Key Observations
- After each operation, the maximum value in `nums` is reduced to a lower number.
- The only way to perform an operation is if the numbers **above `h` are all the same**, which you must check at every step.
- Each operation reduces all identical "high" values to the next valid lower `h`.

---

### ‚õî When is it impossible?
- If at any stage, there's no valid `h` to choose from (because the values above `h` are **not all equal**).
- Or, if any value is **below `k`** to begin with.

---

### üì¶ Final Thoughts
This problem is about **controlled reduction** using **constraints on what you can reduce to**.  
The optimal strategy is a **greedy, step-by-step lowering** of the array‚Äôs values‚Äîalways picking the largest possible valid `h` just above `k`, and moving down.
