To solve **Leetcode 3333 â€“ Find the Original Typed String II**, let's first **understand the problem** and then break down the **approach** step by step without writing code.

---

### ðŸ§  **Problem Summary**

You're given:

* A string `word` â€” the final result that Alice typed.
* An integer `k` â€” the minimum length of the original string Alice *intended* to type.

Because Alice may have **pressed keys for too long**, **some characters might be repeated** more times than she intended.

Your task is to **count all possible original strings** (length â‰¥ `k`) that could have **led to** `word` if long presses are allowed.

### ðŸ§© **Key Observations**

1. **Repeats must stay grouped**: If the final string has `"aaabbb"`, it's not possible the original had `"aba"` â€” because "a" and "b" are not grouped in `word`.
2. **Each group of characters in `word` could come from a smaller number of repetitions.**

   * `"aaa"` could have originated from: `"a"`, `"aa"`, or `"aaa"`
3. For each group of repeated characters (like `aaa`), the number of ways it could have originated is equal to the **count of different lengths** from `1` to its length.

---

### ðŸ§­ **Approach Overview**

#### 1. **Group Characters**

Split `word` into **runs** (or groups) of consecutive identical characters. For example:

* `word = "aabbccdd"` â†’ groups: `["aa", "bb", "cc", "dd"]`

#### 2. **Dynamic Programming**

Use **DP to count the number of possible original strings** of varying lengths that could expand to `word`.

Let:

* `dp[i] = number of ways to reconstruct the first i groups`
* `total_length[i] = total length of the current original string so far`

For each group (say of length `n`), we can choose to keep `1`, `2`, ..., `n` characters â€” so we loop over those and accumulate the counts.

#### 3. **Length Tracking**

We must **only count combinations where the total original string length â‰¥ `k`**.

So we need to **track the total original length** while building up possibilities.

That means:

* Our DP table must also track the **length of the original string** used so far (like a 2D DP: `dp[group_index][current_length]`)

#### 4. **Optimization with Prefix Sums**

Since character group sizes can be large (up to `5 * 10^5`), we optimize inner loops using **prefix sums** to accumulate valid lengths efficiently.

---

### ðŸ§® **Final Computation**

After processing all groups, sum the number of combinations with original string length `â‰¥ k`.

Return the result modulo `1e9 + 7`.

---

### âœ… **Summary**

* Parse `word` into **runs of repeated characters**.
* Use **DP** where `dp[i][l]` represents the number of ways to reach group `i` with original string length `l`.
* For each group, use prefix sums to efficiently compute ways to reach new lengths based on allowed compressed sizes (1 to length of the group).
* At the end, **sum all `dp[last_group][l]` for `l â‰¥ k`**.

This approach efficiently finds all valid original strings that could have expanded into `word` through long presses.
