### **Real-World Examples of Usage**  

This algorithm can be applied in several real-world scenarios where optimizing a sequence of multiplications based on priority is crucial. Here are two practical examples:

### **1. Financial Portfolio Growth Optimization**  
ðŸ“ˆ **Scenario:**  
A hedge fund manager is selecting investments for a portfolio over a limited number of trades (`k`). Each investment has:  
- A **value** (equivalent to `nums[i]` in the problem).  
- A **risk score** (equivalent to the "prime score"), which is calculated based on the volatility of the asset.  

**Goal:**  
The manager wants to maximize portfolio growth by selecting investments in a way that multiplies their capital optimally while minimizing risk. Using this algorithm, the manager can:  
- Identify dominant investments (similar to finding dominant numbers in subarrays).  
- Prioritize high-value, low-risk investments for multiplication first.  
- Optimize trading within `k` transactions for maximum return.

### **2. Data Compression Optimization**  
ðŸ—œ **Scenario:**  
A data storage company wants to compress a dataset efficiently while maintaining the highest retrieval speed.  
Each **file segment** (analogous to `nums[i]`) has:  
- A **compression efficiency score** (higher values are better).  
- A **complexity factor** (like the prime score, based on the number of distinct transformations needed).  

**Goal:**  
To compress `k` segments in a way that maximizes the overall compression ratio.  
- The algorithm identifies the best segments to process first.  
- Uses priority selection to ensure the highest gain from each step.  
- Optimizes data storage while minimizing computation.

These examples demonstrate how the problem's core logicâ€”**prioritizing elements with structured dominance rules**â€”can be applied in finance, data compression, and many other areas. ðŸš€
