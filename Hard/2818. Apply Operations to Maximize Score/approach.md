### **Approach to Solve the Problem**

To maximize the score efficiently, we need to carefully select subarrays and elements based on their **prime score** and their value. Let's break the approach into structured steps:

---

### **1. Precompute Prime Scores for All Numbers**
Each number's **prime score** is the count of distinct prime factors.  
- We preprocess this using a sieve-like approach to efficiently determine the prime factors for each number up to the maximum value in `nums`.

---

### **2. Determine the Best Choices for Multiplication**
- We need to **prioritize elements with high prime scores**, as they contribute to higher multiplications.
- If multiple numbers have the same prime score, **choose the leftmost one** (smallest index).
- We should maintain a **sorted structure** (like a max-heap or sorted list) to efficiently retrieve the best candidate for multiplication.

---

### **3. Use a Sliding Window or Monotonic Stack for Efficient Subarray Selection**
- Instead of brute-forcing over all subarrays, we can use a **monotonic stack** or **sorted data structure** to efficiently track the best elements for any valid subarray.
- The goal is to **maximize the number chosen** in each operation while ensuring we haven't used the same subarray before.

---

### **4. Perform Multiplications and Update Score**
- Start with `score = 1`.
- Pick the **best element** from a valid subarray (highest prime score, leftmost if tied).
- Multiply `score` by the chosen element and take modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- Repeat for at most `k` times.

---

### **5. Edge Cases to Consider**
- If `k` is larger than the number of unique subarrays, stop early.
- If all numbers have the same prime score, the leftmost rule decides.
- If `nums` has only one element, the answer is just multiplying it `k` times.

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
1. **Prime Score Calculation** â†’ \( O(N \log M) \) (Sieve-like approach, where \(M\) is the max value in `nums`)
2. **Sorting & Data Structures** â†’ \( O(N \log N) \)
3. **Processing `k` Operations** â†’ \( O(k \log N) \)

Overall, an optimized approach would run in **\(O(N \log M + N \log N + k \log N)\), which is feasible for large inputs**.
