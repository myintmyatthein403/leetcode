The problem is a **backtracking and recursion** challenge that explores **all possible ways** to combine 4 numbers using arithmetic operations to reach a **target value of 24**.

---

## ✅ **Approach Overview (No Code)**

### 🔁 1. **Use Backtracking to Explore All Possibilities**

* Since there are only **4 numbers**, the total number of combinations is small enough to try them all using **recursive search**.

---

### 🔢 2. **Generate All Permutations of Numbers**

* The order in which you apply operations matters (e.g., `1 + 2 * 3` is different from `(1 + 2) * 3`).
* So for each recursive step, you try **all pairings** of numbers and **all orderings**.

---

### ➕➖✖️➗ 3. **Try All Operations Between Each Pair**

* For every two selected numbers, you try all **4 operations** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
* For division, make sure to **avoid division by zero**.

---

### 🔁 4. **Reduce the Problem Size Recursively**

* Once you perform an operation between two numbers, you:

  * Remove them from the list.
  * Add the result back.
  * Recurse on the smaller list.
* This simulates: "What happens if we combine `a op b`, then solve with the result + remaining numbers?"

---

### 🎯 5. **Base Case: One Number Left**

* If after operations you're left with one number, check if it's **close enough to 24** (e.g., within `1e-6` to handle floating point errors).

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Floating Point Precision:** Because of division, results can be non-integer, so we check using a tolerance (not `== 24`, but `Math.abs(x - 24) < 1e-6`).
* **Commutative Properties:**

  * You can optimize slightly by skipping duplicate expressions for commutative operators (`a + b` is same as `b + a`), but it's not necessary to pass the problem.

## 🧠 Summary

You're simulating all ways to combine 4 numbers using arithmetic, and recursively reducing the problem as you "consume" numbers via operations. It's a **typical recursive + backtracking** pattern where:

1. Choose 2 numbers
2. Apply an operation
3. Recurse on the new set of numbers
4. Repeat until one number is left

If that number is 24, return `true`.
