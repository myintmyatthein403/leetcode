Great question — this one is quite tricky because of the combination of **diagonal traversal**, **sequence matching**, and **at most one 90° clockwise turn**. Let’s break the problem down step by step into an **approach and reasoning** (no code).

---

## 🔑 Key Observations

1. **Sequence Rule**
   Every valid segment must:

   * Start with `1`.
   * Then follow `2, 0, 2, 0, …`.
   * This means the parity of the index (after the `1`) dictates whether you expect `2` or `0`.

2. **Diagonal Directions**
   There are 4 diagonals:

   * Top-left → bottom-right (↘)
   * Bottom-right → top-left (↖)
   * Top-right → bottom-left (↙)
   * Bottom-left → top-right (↗)

3. **One Turn Rule**
   You can travel along one diagonal, and at most once make a **90° clockwise turn** into another diagonal, continuing the sequence.

4. **Problem Type**
   This is essentially **longest path following strict rules**, but the grid is small enough (`500 x 500`) that we can do DP/precomputation.

## ⚡ Step 1: Precompute Straight Diagonal Runs

For each cell `(i, j)`, we want to know:

* How long of a valid sequence we can extend **in each diagonal direction** without turning.

We can do this using DP, checking each diagonal direction.
For example:

* `dp[i][j][dir]` = length of valid segment starting at `(i, j)` in direction `dir` (without turning).

This works because:

* If `(i, j)` has the expected number, then
  `dp[i][j][dir] = 1 + dp[next_i][next_j][dir]`.
* Otherwise, it’s `0`.

So, for each of the 4 diagonals, we fill in precomputed “straight valid lengths”.

---

## ⚡ Step 2: Combine Runs with a Clockwise Turn

Now, for each cell `(i, j)` that starts with `1`:

* Pick a direction `dir1`.
* Walk straight along `dir1` following the sequence until some point `(x, y)`.
* At `(x, y)`, make a **clockwise 90° turn** into `dir2`.
* The maximum V-shaped length is:
  `dp_straight[(i, j)][dir1] + dp_straight[(x, y)][dir2] - 1`
  (subtract 1 because `(x, y)` is counted twice).

This gives us the best possible “turning” V-shape.

If we **never turn**, just take the straight run length.

## ⚡ Step 3: Iterate All Possible Starts

* Every `1` in the grid is a possible starting point.
* For each `1`, consider:

  * Longest straight diagonal.
  * Longest diagonal with a turn (try each possible turn point).
* Track the global maximum.

## 🔎 Example Walkthrough

Take Example 1:

```
[[2,2,1,2,2],
 [2,0,2,2,0],
 [2,0,1,1,0],
 [1,0,2,2,2],
 [2,0,0,2,2]]
```

* Start at `(0,2)` which is `1`.
* Straight diagonal ↘: `(0,2) → (1,3) → (2,4)` gives `1 → 2 → 0`.
* At `(2,4)` we turn clockwise (↘ → ↙).
* Continue `(2,4) → (3,3) → (4,2)` gives `2 → 0`.
* Total length = 5.

This matches the output.

## ⏱ Complexity

* **DP Precomputation**: `O(n*m*4)` for each diagonal.
* **Combining with turn**: each start is checked once, also `O(n*m*4)`.
* Overall: `O(n*m)`, efficient for `500x500`.

---

✅ **In summary**:

1. Precompute valid diagonal segment lengths in all 4 directions (straight only).
2. For each starting `1`, check:

   * Straight maximum.
   * Best turn by combining two diagonals.
3. Return the global max length.
