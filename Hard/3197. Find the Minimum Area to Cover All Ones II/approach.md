Alright, letâ€™s break this down step by step into an **approach (no code)** for **LeetCode 3197. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II**.

---

### ðŸ”Ž Problem Restatement

Weâ€™re given a binary grid with some cells containing `1`.
We need to cover **all 1â€™s** using exactly **3 non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles**.
Our goal: minimize the **sum of their areas**.
Rectangles can touch, but **must not overlap**.

---

### âš¡ Key Observations

1. **Bounding Rectangle Principle**:

   * To cover a group of 1â€™s with a rectangle, the smallest possible rectangle is defined by the min/max row and col of the 1â€™s inside that group.
   * Area = `(maxRow - minRow + 1) * (maxCol - minCol + 1)`.

2. **Partitioning into 3 Groups**:

   * Since we need 3 rectangles, weâ€™re essentially **partitioning the set of all 1â€™s into 3 groups**.
   * Each group of 1â€™s â†’ gets its bounding rectangle â†’ contributes to total area.

3. **Non-overlapping Constraint**:

   * Rectangles can share edges but **not overlap**.
   * So groups of 1â€™s must be disjoint in cells.

4. **Grid Size Constraint**:

   * `n, m â‰¤ 30`, so brute force over all partitions of 1â€™s is infeasible (too many subsets).
   * But since the grid is small, we can consider **splitting the grid using cuts** (rows/columns) instead of arbitrary subsets.

### ðŸš€ Approach

We want to minimize total rectangle area. A structured way is:

#### Step 1: Collect coordinates of all 1â€™s

* Build a list of `(row, col)` for all 1â€™s.
* There are at most `900` cells.

#### Step 2: Think of partitioning strategies

Since rectangles must cover **all 1â€™s**, we can partition by **cuts** in the grid:

* **Two vertical cuts** â†’ grid split into 3 vertical bands.
* **Two horizontal cuts** â†’ grid split into 3 horizontal bands.
* **Mixed cuts**:

  * 1 vertical cut + 1 horizontal cut (â†’ creates 4 regions, but we can pick the best 3 that cover all 1â€™s).
* Try all possible partitions.

For each partitioning:

* Assign each 1 to one of the 3 groups (based on cut region).
* Compute bounding rectangle + area for each group.
* Ensure no overlaps.
* Sum the areas.

#### Step 3: Handle degeneracies

* Some partitions may leave one region empty â†’ invalid (since we need exactly 3 rectangles with non-zero area).
* Skip those cases.

#### Step 4: Minimize

* Iterate over all possible cuts (O(nÂ² + mÂ² + nm)) â€” feasible since `n, m â‰¤ 30`.
* Compute sum of rectangle areas.
* Track the minimum.

### ðŸ“Š Complexity

* **Cuts to try**:

  * Vertical: O(mÂ²)
  * Horizontal: O(nÂ²)
  * Mixed: O(nm)
* For each cut, computing bounding boxes = O(#ones) â‰¤ 900.
* Total complexity â‰ˆ `O(30Â² * 900)` = **manageable**.

---

### âœ… Intuition with Examples

1. Example 1 (`[[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]`)

   * Best split is by vertical cuts around columns â†’ three groups.
   * Each groupâ€™s rectangle is minimal â†’ total area = 5.

2. Example 2 (`[[1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1]]`)

   * Best split is mix: group left (col 0 & 2), group middle (col 1), group right (col 3).
   * Total area = 5.

### ðŸ§  Key Insight

This problem is less about arbitrary grouping of 1â€™s and more about **grid partitioning into 3 regions**. Since grid size is small, brute forcing partitions via row/column cuts is both **simpler** and **efficient enough**.
