Sure, let's break down the approach step by step for solving the problem "Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting" in JavaScript.

### Problem Understanding
Given an array `favorite` where `favorite[i]` is the index of the employee that employee `i` likes, we need to determine the maximum number of employees that can be invited to a meeting such that every invited employee either likes another invited employee or is liked by another invited employee.

### Approach

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Represent the problem as a directed graph where each node is an employee and there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `favorite[i]`.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Detect cycles in the graph. Each cycle represents a group of employees that can be invited together.

3. **Chain Detection**:
   - Detect chains leading to cycles. These chains can be added to the cycles to maximize the number of employees invited.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Create an array `visited` to keep track of visited nodes.
   - Create an array `inCycle` to mark nodes that are part of a cycle.
   - Create an array `chainLength` to store the maximum chain length leading to each node.

2. **DFS for Cycle Detection**:
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles and mark nodes in them.

3. **Calculate Maximum Invites**:
   - Calculate the maximum number of employees that can be invited by considering the cycles and chains.

### Visualization

Let's visualize the data structure and the steps with an example:

**Input:** `favorite = [2, 2, 1, 2]`

1. **Graph Representation**:
   ```
   0 -> 2
   1 -> 2
   2 -> 1
   3 -> 2
   ```

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Start DFS from node 0:
     - Visit node 0, then node 2, then node 1, which leads back to node 2 (cycle detected: 2 -> 1 -> 2).
   - Start DFS from node 3:
     - Visit node 3, then node 2 (already visited, part of the cycle).

3. **Chain Detection**:
   - Node 0 and node 3 are chains leading to the cycle 2 -> 1 -> 2.

4. **Calculate Maximum Invites**:
   - The cycle 2 -> 1 -> 2 has 2 nodes.
   - Adding chains from node 0 and node 3, we get a total of 3 nodes.

### JavaScript Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} favorite
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumInvitations = function(favorite) {
    const n = favorite.length;
    const reversedGraph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);

    // Build the reversed graph where each node points to its admirers
    for (let person = 0; person < n; person++) {
        reversedGraph[favorite[person]].push(person);
    }

    const visited = new Array(n).fill(false);
    let longestCycle = 0;
    let twoCycleInvitations = 0;

    // Helper function to calculate the maximum distance from a given start node
    const bfs = (startNode, visitedNodes, reversedGraph) => {
        const queue = [[startNode, 0]];
        let maxDistance = 0;
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const [currentNode, currentDistance] = queue.shift();
            for (const neighbor of reversedGraph[currentNode]) {
                if (visitedNodes.has(neighbor)) continue;
                visitedNodes.add(neighbor);
                queue.push([neighbor, currentDistance + 1]);
                maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, currentDistance + 1);
            }
        }
        return maxDistance;
    };

    // Find all cycles in the graph
    for (let person = 0; person < n; person++) {
        if (!visited[person]) {
            const visitedPersons = new Map();
            let currentPerson = person;
            let distance = 0;
            while (true) {
                if (visited[currentPerson]) break;
                visited[currentPerson] = true;
                visitedPersons.set(currentPerson, distance);
                distance += 1;
                const nextPerson = favorite[currentPerson];

                // Cycle detected
                if (visitedPersons.has(nextPerson)) {
                    const cycleLength = distance - visitedPersons.get(nextPerson);
                    longestCycle = Math.max(longestCycle, cycleLength);

                    // Handle cycles of length 2
                    if (cycleLength === 2) {
                        const visitedNodes = new Set([currentPerson, nextPerson]);
                        twoCycleInvitations += 2 + bfs(nextPerson, visitedNodes, reversedGraph) + bfs(currentPerson, visitedNodes, reversedGraph);
                    }
                    break;
                }
                currentPerson = nextPerson;
            }
        }
    }

    return Math.max(longestCycle, twoCycleInvitations);
};

// Example usage:
const favorite = [2, 2, 1, 2];
console.log(maximumInvitations(favorite)); // Output: 3
```

This code follows the described approach and calculates the maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting. The expected output for the given input is 3.
