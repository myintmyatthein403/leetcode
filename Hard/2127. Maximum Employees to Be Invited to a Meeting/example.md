Here are two real-world examples where the approach to solving the "Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting" problem can be applied:

### Example 1: Social Network Event Planning

**Scenario:**
A social network platform is organizing a special event and wants to invite the maximum number of users such that each invited user either follows another invited user or is followed by another invited user.

**Application:**
- **Graph Representation:** Each user is represented as a node, and a directed edge from node `i` to node `favorite[i]` indicates that user `i` follows user `favorite[i]`.
- **Cycle Detection:** Detect cycles in the graph to identify groups of users who follow each other in a loop.
- **Chain Detection:** Identify chains of users leading to these cycles to maximize the number of invited users.
- **Result:** The platform can use the algorithm to determine the maximum number of users to invite, ensuring that the event has a high level of interaction and engagement.

### Example 2: Corporate Team Building Activity

**Scenario:**
A company is planning a team-building activity and wants to invite the maximum number of employees such that each invited employee either likes another invited employee or is liked by another invited employee.

**Application:**
- **Graph Representation:** Each employee is represented as a node, and a directed edge from node `i` to node `favorite[i]` indicates that employee `i` likes employee `favorite[i]`.
- **Cycle Detection:** Detect cycles in the graph to identify groups of employees who like each other in a loop.
- **Chain Detection:** Identify chains of employees leading to these cycles to maximize the number of invited employees.
- **Result:** The company can use the algorithm to determine the maximum number of employees to invite, ensuring that the team-building activity fosters positive relationships and collaboration among employees.

In both examples, the approach helps in maximizing the number of participants while ensuring that each participant has a connection with at least one other participant, thereby enhancing the overall experience and engagement.
