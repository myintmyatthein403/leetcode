Here are **2 real-world usage examples** of this fixed-bound subarray logic, plus **1 web development scenario** where it could be applied:

### ‚úÖ **Real World Example 1: Sensor Range Monitoring**

Imagine you‚Äôre monitoring temperature data from a sensor array in a factory.  
You want to know how many **contiguous time periods** had temperatures that **included both the lowest safe limit (minK)** and **highest safe limit (maxK)** ‚Äî no more, no less.

- `nums = [72, 74, 70, 76, 80]`
- `minK = 70`, `maxK = 80`  
- Count how many valid monitoring windows contained both thresholds.

This helps identify **balanced operating periods**.

### ‚úÖ **Real World Example 2: Stock Price Stability Detection**

A financial analyst might want to analyze stock prices for a company over time (`nums`).  
They're looking for all periods where:
- The **lowest price hits a known support level (`minK`)**
- The **highest price hits a resistance level (`maxK`)**
  
These fixed-bound subarrays tell them how many **stable fluctuations** occurred within expected trading bounds ‚Äî useful for **volatility modeling**.

### üåê **Web Development Example: User Rating Analysis**

Suppose you're building a review analytics dashboard. You have user ratings over time stored in an array (`nums`), and you want to find periods of time where user ratings **ranged exactly from `minK` to `maxK`**, such as:

- `minK = 1 star`, `maxK = 5 stars`  
- Helps identify periods of **polarized feedback** where users either loved or hated the product (no in-between).

This can be visualized with time-series charts or used to **trigger alert systems** for product managers.
