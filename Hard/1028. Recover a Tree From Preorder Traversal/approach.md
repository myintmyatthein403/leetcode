To reconstruct the binary tree from the given preorder traversal string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of nodes and their corresponding depths as we parse the string.

2. **Parse the String**: Iterate through the traversal string to identify each node's value and its depth, which is indicated by the number of preceding dashes ('-').

3. **Determine Node Placement**:
   - **Depth Matching**: Compare the depth of the current node with the depth of the node on top of the stack.
     - If the current node's depth is greater by one, it is the left child of the node on the stack's top.
     - If the current node's depth is equal, it is the right child of the node below the top of the stack.
     - If the current node's depth is less, pop nodes from the stack until finding the correct parent node.

4. **Attach the Node**: Once the correct parent is identified, attach the current node as its left or right child accordingly.

5. **Update the Stack**: Push the current node onto the stack to maintain the correct parent-child relationships for subsequent nodes.

By following this approach, we can reconstruct the binary tree in a single pass through the traversal string, ensuring that each node is placed in its correct position based on its depth and the preorder traversal order.
