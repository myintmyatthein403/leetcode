Preorder depth-first search (DFS) is a fundamental tree traversal technique with several practical applications in computer science and real-world scenarios. Here are two notable examples:

1. **Expression Tree Evaluation:**

   In compilers and interpreters, mathematical expressions are often represented using expression trees, where internal nodes denote operators and leaf nodes represent operands. Preorder traversal is utilized to convert these trees into prefix notation (Polish notation), which is advantageous for certain computational processes. This traversal processes the root node (operator) before its subtrees (operands), effectively translating the expression into a format suitable for stack-based evaluations. For instance, the expression tree for "(A - B) * C" would be traversed in preorder to yield "* - A B C", facilitating efficient computation. citeturn0search18

2. **File System Navigation:**

   File systems are commonly structured as hierarchical directories, resembling a tree where directories are nodes and files/subdirectories are children. Preorder traversal is employed by file system explorers to list directories and their contents systematically. By visiting a directory (node) before its files and subdirectories (children), the traversal ensures that each directory is processed prior to its contents, maintaining an organized and intuitive listing order. This approach is particularly useful in applications that require displaying directory structures, such as graphical file explorers and command-line tools.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of preorder DFS in efficiently managing and processing hierarchical data structures across various domains.
