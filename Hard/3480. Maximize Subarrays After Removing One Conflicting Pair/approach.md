To solve **Leetcode 3480. Maximize Subarrays After Removing One Conflicting Pair**, the main idea is to understand how conflicting pairs restrict subarrays and how removing one pair can maximize the number of valid subarrays.

### üîç Problem Breakdown

* You are given:

  * A sorted array `nums = [1, 2, ..., n]`.
  * Some **conflicting pairs** ‚Äî if a pair `[a, b]` exists, no subarray is allowed to include **both `a` and `b`**.
* You are allowed to **remove exactly one pair**.
* The goal is to **count the number of subarrays** that do **not** include both elements of any remaining pair, and return the **maximum** such count.

### üí° Key Observations

1. **Total Number of Subarrays** of `nums` is:

   $$
   \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   $$

2. Each conflicting pair `[a, b]` reduces the count of valid subarrays by **excluding all subarrays that contain both `a` and `b`**.

3. By removing one conflicting pair, we can **regain** some of the lost subarrays. We aim to **maximize** the number of subarrays by choosing the optimal pair to remove.

### ‚úÖ Approach (No Code)

#### Step 1: Preprocess Position Information

* Since `nums = [1, 2, ..., n]`, each element‚Äôs **index = value - 1**.
* So the position of any value `x` is simply `x - 1`.

---

#### Step 2: For Each Conflicting Pair `[a, b]`

* Determine how many subarrays contain both `a` and `b`:

  * Let `i = min(a, b) - 1`, `j = max(a, b) - 1`.
  * The number of subarrays that contain both `a` and `b` is:

    $$
    (i + 1) \cdot (n - j)
    $$
  * This is derived from choosing any start index ‚â§ `i` and end index ‚â• `j` (inclusive).

#### Step 3: Compute Total Invalid Subarrays for All Pairs

* For each pair, calculate how many subarrays are invalid due to it.
* Sum these to get the **total number of subarrays lost**.

---

#### Step 4: Try Removing Each Conflicting Pair

* For each conflicting pair:

  * Remove it temporarily.
  * Recalculate the number of invalid subarrays **without** that pair.
  * Total valid subarrays = total subarrays - remaining invalid subarrays.
* Track the **maximum** valid subarrays obtained over all possible choices.

---

#### Step 5: Return the Maximum

* The answer is the **maximum number of valid subarrays** obtained after removing one pair.

---

### üß† Intuition

* Removing the **most "damaging"** conflicting pair (i.e., the one that invalidates the most subarrays) often yields the best result.
* The insight is in understanding how conflicting pairs translate to rectangle-shaped zones of invalid subarrays.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

* Let `m = conflictingPairs.length`.
* Preprocessing all conflicting pairs: **O(m)**
* Trying each removal and recomputing the rest: **O(m)** (can optimize further using prefix sums or total sum - current pair's contribution)

So total time is linear in terms of `m`, i.e. **O(m)**, which is efficient for `m ‚â§ 2n`.
