Here are **2 real-world software development examples** and **1 web development example** where the logic or concept behind the "Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes" problem can be applied:

---

### üß† **Software Development Example 1: Package Dependency Management**

**Scenario:**
In systems like npm, pip, or Maven, installing a software package might require unlocking and accessing dependent packages.

* **Boxes** = software packages.
* **Candies** = features or code inside packages.
* **Keys** = dependencies that allow access to other packages.
* **Contained Boxes** = nested packages or submodules.

**How this maps:**
Installing an open package gives access to its features, reveals other dependent packages (containedBoxes), and may provide keys (dependency metadata) to unlock/install more packages. The goal is to unlock as many features (candies) as possible, while resolving dependencies in a valid order.

### üß† **Software Development Example 2: Access Control in Enterprise Systems**

**Scenario:**
In enterprise environments, access to files, systems, or tools may be hierarchical or permission-based.

* **Boxes** = user roles or secure systems.
* **Candies** = data or functionality accessible through a role/system.
* **Keys** = permissions or credentials granted upon access.
* **Contained Boxes** = nested roles or linked systems.

**How this maps:**
Accessing a role gives you permission to more systems (keys) and access to secure environments (containedBoxes). The total usable features depend on how many systems and permissions you can unlock from your initial roles.

### üåê **Web Development Example: Progressive Web App (PWA) Feature Unlocking**

**Scenario:**
In web apps (especially games or educational apps), features might unlock progressively based on user actions.

* **Boxes** = feature modules (e.g., quizzes, levels, challenges).
* **Candies** = rewards, user points, or new content.
* **Keys** = achievements or tokens that unlock more features.
* **Contained Boxes** = hidden or locked modules revealed by completing others.

**How this maps:**
As the user interacts with the app (opens boxes), they collect rewards and unlock keys that allow access to more advanced modules (contained boxes). The goal is to maximize user engagement or learning by dynamically unlocking paths through the app based on progress.

### üß© Summary

| Domain         | Analogy Use                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Software Dev 1 | Dependency resolution and package management           |
| Software Dev 2 | Access control based on dynamic permission propagation |
| Web Dev        | Unlockable content in PWAs or gamified apps            |

These examples show how this kind of dynamic, dependency-based unlocking is common across software systems.
