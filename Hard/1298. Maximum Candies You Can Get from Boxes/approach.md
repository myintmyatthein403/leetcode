To solve the problem **"1298. Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes"**, we can think of this as a **graph traversal problem** with dynamic unlocking of nodes (boxes). Here's how to approach it step-by-step:

---

### âœ… **Key Concepts**

* You can only **open** a box if:

  * You **have it** (either initially or found inside another box).
  * You **have the key** to it (or itâ€™s already open).
* Opening a box may:

  * Give you **candies**.
  * Provide you **keys** to other boxes.
  * Provide you more **contained boxes**.

---

### ðŸ§  **Approach Overview**

We simulate the process using a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach, maintaining a queue of boxes we are ready to process (i.e., open). We also keep track of:

1. **Which boxes we have**.
2. **Which keys we have**.
3. **Which boxes are open** or can now be opened because we just got the key.

---

### ðŸ”„ **Steps**

1. **Initialize**:

   * A set or queue (`to_process`) of boxes we can start with (from `initialBoxes`).
   * A set of keys we currently have.
   * A set of boxes we have seen but cannot open yet (because we don't have the key).
   * A visited set to avoid processing the same box twice.

2. **BFS Loop**:

   * While there are boxes we can open:

     * Pick a box from the queue.
     * If itâ€™s **closed and we donâ€™t have the key**, skip it for now.
     * If we can open it:

       * Add its candies to total.
       * Mark it as visited.
       * Add any **new keys** it contains.

         * This may allow us to unlock previously skipped boxes.
       * Add any **contained boxes** to our set of known boxes.

         * If any are already open or now unlockable, we can process them.
     * Repeat until no more boxes can be opened.

3. **Loop until no progress**:

   * Since getting a key may allow opening a previously locked box, we loop until **no new boxes** are opened in a full iteration.

---

### ðŸ§® Time Complexity

* **O(n)**, since:

  * Each box is processed at most once.
  * All keys, containedBoxes, and candies are processed linearly.

---

### âœ… Key Edge Cases

* Some boxes are never unlockable (we never get their key).
* A key might be inside a box that itself is locked and inaccessible.
* A cycle of dependencies doesn't matter since we track visited and unvisited status.

---

This method guarantees that we maximize the number of candies we collect by exploring all accessible paths of keys and boxes starting from `initialBoxes`.
