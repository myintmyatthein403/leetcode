To solve **Leetcode 2402. Meeting Rooms III**, the key idea is to simulate the meeting allocation process while efficiently managing room availability and delays using priority queues (min-heaps). Here’s a step-by-step **approach and explanation** (no code):

---

### **1. Sort Meetings by Start Time**

* Since all `starti` are unique, we can sort the meetings by their start time.
* This ensures we always process meetings in the correct chronological order.

---

### **2. Use Two Heaps to Manage Room States**

* **Available Rooms Heap**:

  * A min-heap of currently free room numbers.
  * Always assign the meeting to the room with the **lowest number**.

* **Occupied Rooms Heap**:

  * A min-heap that stores `[endTime, roomNumber]` for each occupied room.
  * Tracks when each room will be free.

---

### **3. Process Each Meeting**

For each meeting `[start, end]`:

#### a. Free Up Rooms

* Check the top of the `occupied rooms heap`.
* While the earliest `endTime ≤ current start time`, that room is done — move it back to the `available rooms heap`.

#### b. Assign the Room

* **If an available room exists**:

  * Pop the lowest-numbered room.
  * Assign the meeting as is.
  * Push `[end, roomNumber]` into `occupied rooms heap`.

* **If no room is free**:

  * Delay the meeting.
  * Pop the room that becomes available **earliest**.
  * Compute the **new start and end time** using the original meeting duration.
  * Push the delayed meeting with its new end time into the `occupied rooms heap`.

* In both cases, track the number of meetings handled by each room (using a counter array).

---

### **4. Return the Room with Most Meetings**

* After processing all meetings, scan the counter array to find the room that handled the most meetings.
* In case of a tie, return the room with the **lowest number**.

---

### **Why This Works Efficiently**

* All operations on heaps are logarithmic in nature.
* Sorting takes `O(m log m)`, where `m = number of meetings`.
* Each meeting goes through heap operations (add/remove), which are `O(log n)`, with `n ≤ 100`.
* So, the total time complexity is efficient: `O(m log m + m log n)`.

---

### **Key Concepts Applied**

* **Greedy**: Always pick the earliest available room.
* **Simulation**: Recreate the scheduling process step by step.
* **Priority Queue / Min-Heap**: Efficiently manage and query the soonest available room and lowest room number.
