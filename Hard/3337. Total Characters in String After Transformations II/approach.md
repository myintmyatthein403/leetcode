This solution uses **matrix exponentiation** to solve the string transformation problem in a highly **optimized and scalable** way. Letâ€™s walk through the **approach and intuition** step by step â€” without diving into code.

## âœ… High-Level Idea

The transformation of characters can be thought of as a **transition system**: each character transforms into a set of other characters. This behavior can be captured and repeated using **matrix multiplication**.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

### 1. **Character Mapping as a Matrix**

* Define a **26x26 matrix `T`** where `T[i][j]` means: after 1 transformation, how many times character `j` turns into character `i`.
* For example, if `nums[0] = 3` and `s[i] = 'a'`, then `'a'` turns into `"bcd"`. So we set `T[b][a] = 1`, `T[c][a] = 1`, `T[d][a] = 1`.

> Essentially, each column `j` of `T` tells you how character `j` is transformed into other characters.

---

### 2. **Matrix Exponentiation**

* We raise the matrix `T` to the power `t` â†’ this gives us the **composite transformation** after `t` rounds.
* The result `T^t` tells us, for each original character `j`, how it spreads into other characters after `t` rounds.

---

### 3. **Initial Frequency Vector**

* Create a frequency vector `f` of length 26 from the original string `s` where `f[i]` is the number of times character `i` appears in `s`.

---

### 4. **Final Transformation**

* Multiply the matrix `T^t` with the frequency vector `f`.
* The resulting vector contains the count of each character **after `t` transformations**.
* Sum up the values in the result to get the final length of the string.

---

## âš¡ Why This is Efficient

* Instead of expanding the string at every transformation (which can be exponentially large), this method models the process **mathematically**.
* Using **matrix exponentiation by squaring**, we reduce the transformation process from `O(t)` to `O(log t)` matrix multiplications.
* Each multiplication is `O(26^3)`, which is constant in terms of input size.

---

## ðŸ”¢ Time Complexity

* Matrix exponentiation: `O(26^3 * log t)` â†’ efficient due to fixed matrix size.
* Final frequency multiplication: `O(26^2)`
* Overall: practically constant for all inputs (`s.length` affects only the initial frequency count).

---

## âœ… Summary

This is a **clever mathematical optimization** that:

* Models character transformations using a matrix.
* Applies **fast matrix exponentiation** to simulate `t` transformations.
* Uses a **frequency vector** to compute the final result without building strings.
* Avoids exponential blow-up of string size and handles very large `t` efficiently.
