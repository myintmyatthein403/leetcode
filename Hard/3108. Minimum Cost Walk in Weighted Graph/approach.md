### **Approach Explanation**  

The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost of a walk between two given vertices, where the cost is calculated as the **bitwise AND** of the weights of all traversed edges.

---

### **Understanding the Problem**
1. **Graph Representation**  
   - The input graph is **undirected and weighted**, meaning that edges can be traversed in both directions.
   - Some vertices may not be connected, which means some queries might not have a valid walk.

2. **Walk Definition**  
   - A walk can revisit edges and vertices.
   - The cost of a walk is the **bitwise AND** of all edge weights in the path.

3. **Key Observations**  
   - The more edges we AND together, the smaller the result (bitwise AND decreases values).
   - Since we are allowed to visit edges multiple times, the minimum cost for a given pair of nodes is determined by the **smallest AND-computable path**.

---

### **Approach**
#### **Step 1: Build the Graph**
- Construct an **adjacency list** representation of the graph where each node stores its connected neighbors along with the corresponding edge weights.

#### **Step 2: Finding Minimum Cost Walk**
For each query \([s_i, t_i]\), we need to compute the **minimum AND cost** from \(s_i\) to \(t_i\).  
A brute-force approach exploring all possible walks would be too slow, so we optimize it as follows:

1. **Precompute Reachable Costs Using BFS or DFS**
   - We explore all possible walks from each node using a **graph traversal algorithm**.
   - Instead of storing distances, we store **the minimum bitwise AND cost** reachable for each node.
   - If a node is revisited with a lower cost, we continue the traversal.

2. **Multi-Source BFS with Priority Queue**
   - Since we want the minimum possible AND-cost, we prioritize edges with **lower AND values**.
   - We can use a **BFS/modified Dijkstraâ€™s approach**, but instead of summing weights, we propagate the **AND cost**.

3. **Bitmask-Based Optimization**
   - Since edge weights are constrained (typically \(O(2^{10})\) values), we can **group nodes by AND-cost buckets** and efficiently propagate the lowest values.

#### **Step 3: Answer the Queries**
- If we precompute the minimum AND-costs for all node pairs, answering each query is **O(1)**.
- If we use BFS/DFS per query, it runs in **O(E + V log V)**, which is feasible for moderate constraints.

---

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Graph Construction:** \(O(E)\)  
- **Preprocessing (Multi-source BFS or Floyd-Warshall-like approach):** \(O(V \cdot \log V + E)\)  
- **Query Processing:** \(O(1)\) if precomputed, \(O(E + V \log V)\) if using BFS per query.

---

### **Edge Cases to Consider**
1. **Disconnected Nodes:** If there is no path between \(s_i\) and \(t_i\), return **-1**.
2. **Single-Edge Paths:** If a direct edge exists, the cost is simply the edge weight.
3. **Multi-Path Optimization:** If multiple paths exist, we need to pick the one that minimizes the AND cost.
4. **Loops & Revisits:** Revisiting nodes may help achieve a lower cost.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- The key insight is that the **bitwise AND operation** tends to decrease as more numbers are AND-ed.
- A **priority-based BFS (Dijkstra-like)** or **bitwise filtering strategy** can efficiently find the minimum cost for each query.
- Precomputing reachable AND-costs from every node using **Floyd-Warshall or multi-source BFS** can speed up query responses.
