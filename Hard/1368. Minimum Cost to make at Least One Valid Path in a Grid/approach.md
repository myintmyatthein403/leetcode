To solve this problem, we can use a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm with a deque (double-ended queue) to prioritize paths with lower costs. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `n` and `m` to store the dimensions of the grid.
   - `dirs` to store the possible directions (right, left, down, up).
   - `visited` to keep track of visited cells.
   - `deque` to manage the cells to be processed, initialized with the starting cell (0, 0) and cost 0.

2. **BFS with Deque**:
   - While the deque is not empty, pop the front element (current cell and its cost).
   - If the current cell is the bottom-right cell, return the cost.
   - Mark the current cell as visited.
   - For each possible direction, calculate the new cell coordinates.
   - If the new cell is within bounds and not visited, check if moving to this cell follows the direction indicated by the current cell's value:
     - If it does, add the new cell to the front of the deque with the same cost.
     - If it doesn't, add the new cell to the back of the deque with an incremented cost.

3. **Return**:
   - If the bottom-right cell is not reached, return -1 (though this case shouldn't occur with valid input).

Here's the implementation of this approach:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCost = function (grid) {
  const n = grid.length;
  const m = grid[0].length;
  const dirs = [
    [0, 1],  // right
    [0, -1], // left
    [1, 0],  // down
    [-1, 0], // up
  ];
  const deque = [];
  const visited = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => new Array(m).fill(false));
  deque.push([0, 0, 0]);
  
  while (deque.length) {
    const [x, y, cost] = deque.shift();
    if (x === n - 1 && y === m - 1) {
      return cost;
    }
    if (visited[x][y]) continue;
    visited[x][y] = true;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      const [dx, dy] = dirs[i];
      const nx = x + dx;
      const ny = y + dy;
      if (nx < 0 || nx >= n || ny < 0 || ny >= m || visited[nx][ny]) {
        continue;
      }
      if (grid[x][y] === i + 1) {
        deque.unshift([nx, ny, cost]);
      } else {
        deque.push([nx, ny, cost + 1]);
      }
    }
  }
  return -1;
};
```

This approach ensures that paths with lower costs are processed first, leading to the correct minimum cost to reach the bottom-right cell.
