Here are two real-world examples where a similar approach could be used:

### 1. **Navigation Systems (GPS Routing)**
In navigation systems, finding the shortest path from a starting location to a destination while considering various road conditions (e.g., traffic, road closures) is crucial. The grid can represent a map where each cell indicates a road segment, and the value in each cell indicates the preferred direction of travel (e.g., one-way streets). The BFS with a deque can be used to find the shortest path with the least cost (e.g., travel time or distance) by prioritizing paths that follow the preferred directions.

### 2. **Robot Path Planning**
In robotics, especially for autonomous robots, finding the optimal path in a grid-like environment (e.g., a warehouse) is essential. The grid can represent the warehouse layout, where each cell indicates the preferred direction for the robot to move (e.g., to avoid obstacles or follow predefined paths). Using BFS with a deque helps the robot find the shortest and safest path to its destination, minimizing the cost (e.g., energy consumption or time).

In both examples, the BFS with a deque ensures that paths with lower costs are processed first, leading to efficient and optimal pathfinding solutions.
