To solve the problem **1857. Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph**, we can follow this **step-by-step approach**:

---

## üîç **Problem Summary**

Given a directed graph where each node has a color, you must:

* Find the **maximum number of times** the **same color** appears in any **valid path**.
* If the graph contains a **cycle**, return `-1`.

---

## üß† **Key Concepts**

1. **Topological Sorting** is required to process nodes in dependency order and to **detect cycles**.
2. **Dynamic Programming** (DP) is used to track color frequencies along all paths to a node.
3. We are essentially doing **color frequency propagation** across the graph.

---

## üìå **Detailed Approach**

### 1. **Build the Graph**

* Use an adjacency list to store outgoing edges for each node.
* Also maintain an **indegree array** to know which nodes have no incoming edges (start points for topological sort).

---

### 2. **Prepare Color Frequency Storage**

* For each node, track a frequency array of size 26 (for a‚Äìz) to count how many times each color appears along paths reaching that node.
* For example, `dp[node][c]` stores how many times color `c` appears in the best path ending at `node`.

---

### 3. **Topological Sort with BFS**

* Start with all nodes having `indegree == 0`.
* While processing:

  * Update color frequency for neighbors.
  * Decrement their indegree.
  * If a neighbor's indegree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

---

### 4. **Color Frequency Propagation**

* For each neighbor, compare its current color frequency with the frequency from the current node.
* If the node‚Äôs own color matches the color `c`, increase the frequency count accordingly.

---

### 5. **Track the Maximum Color Value**

* As we propagate, keep updating a global `maxColorValue` by checking the highest value in the color frequency array for each node.

---

### 6. **Cycle Detection**

* Count how many nodes are processed during BFS (topo sort).
* If it's less than `n`, a cycle exists ‚Üí return `-1`.

---

## ‚úÖ **Final Output**

* If there's **no cycle**, return the `maxColorValue` found.
* If a **cycle is detected**, return `-1`.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity**

* **Time:** O(n + m), since each node and edge is processed once.
* **Space:** O(n \* 26) for the DP color frequency table + O(n + m) for the graph and indegree.

---

This approach ensures efficient cycle detection and optimal propagation of color frequencies to compute the result.
