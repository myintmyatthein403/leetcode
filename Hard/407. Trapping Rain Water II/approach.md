To approach the problem of optimizing the `trapRainWater` function, we can use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently manage the cells with the smallest heights. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Create a priority queue to store the cells by their heights.
   - Create a 2D array to keep track of visited cells.

2. **Add Boundary Cells to Priority Queue**:
   - Add all the boundary cells (first and last rows, first and last columns) to the priority queue.
   - Mark these boundary cells as visited.

3. **Process Cells in Priority Queue**:
   - While the priority queue is not empty, extract the cell with the smallest height.
   - For each neighboring cell (up, down, left, right), if it has not been visited:
     - Calculate the water trapped by comparing the current cell's height and the neighbor's height.
     - Update the total water trapped.
     - Add the neighbor cell to the priority queue with the maximum height between the current cell and the neighbor cell.
     - Mark the neighbor cell as visited.

4. **Return the Total Water Trapped**:
   - After processing all cells, return the total water trapped.

Here is the implementation of the above approach:

```javascript
const { MinPriorityQueue } = require('@datastructures-js/priority-queue');

/**
 * @param {number[][]} heightMap
 * @return {number}
 */
var trapRainWater = function(heightMap) {
  const m = heightMap.length;
  const n = heightMap[0].length;
  if (m < 3 || n < 3) return 0;

  const visited = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
  const pq = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: cell => cell.height });
  const dirs = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]];
  let water = 0;

  // Add boundary cells to the priority queue
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    pq.enqueue(new Cell(i, 0, heightMap[i][0]));
    pq.enqueue(new Cell(i, n - 1, heightMap[i][n - 1]));
    visited[i][0] = true;
    visited[i][n - 1] = true;
  }

  for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    pq.enqueue(new Cell(0, j, heightMap[0][j]));
    pq.enqueue(new Cell(m - 1, j, heightMap[m - 1][j]));
    visited[0][j] = true;
    visited[m - 1][j] = true;
  }

  // Process cells in the priority queue
  while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
    const cell = pq.dequeue().element;
    for (const [dx, dy] of dirs) {
      const x = cell.x + dx;
      const y = cell.y + dy;
      if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || visited[x][y]) continue;
      visited[x][y] = true;
      water += Math.max(0, cell.height - heightMap[x][y]);
      pq.enqueue(new Cell(x, y, Math.max(cell.height, heightMap[x][y])));
    }
  }

  return water;
};

class Cell {
  constructor(x, y, height) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.height = height;
  }
}
```

This approach ensures that we efficiently process the cells with the smallest heights first, which helps in calculating the trapped water accurately and avoids the Time Limit Exceeded error.
