This implementation of `kMirror(k, n)` is an **optimized approach** designed to **generate k-mirror numbers efficiently** by leveraging number symmetry, avoiding unnecessary string operations, and using **BigInt** for safe arithmetic on large palindromes.

Letâ€™s break it down step by step, without code:

---

### âœ… **Overall Strategy**

The goal is to find the **sum of the first `n` numbers** that are palindromes:

* in **base-10**, and
* in **base-`k`**.

Rather than checking all numbers sequentially, this solution **constructs base-10 palindromes directly**, which significantly cuts down the search space.

---

### ðŸ”¢ **Step-by-step Approach**

#### 1. **Generate Base-10 Palindromes Directly**

* Use a loop to generate all possible palindromes by mirroring the left half:

  * For **odd-length palindromes**, mirror all digits *except* the last one.
  * For **even-length palindromes**, mirror the full number.

This is done by:

* Iterating from `left = 1` to `right = left * 10`
* Constructing full palindromes from each half

This ensures palindromes are generated in increasing order without checking unnecessary numbers.

---

#### 2. **Convert Each Candidate to Base-`k`**

* For each palindrome (constructed as a `BigInt`), convert it to base-`k`.
* During the conversion, store each digit in a `digit[]` array.

---

#### 3. **Check for Palindrome in Base-`k`**

* Use a two-pointer technique (`i`, `j`) to compare digits in `digit[]`.
* If the base-`k` digits are symmetric, itâ€™s a **k-mirror number**.

---

#### 4. **Count and Sum Valid Results**

* For each valid k-mirror number:

  * Increment the `count`
  * Add the number to the cumulative sum `ans`

Stop once you find `n` valid k-mirror numbers.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Key Optimizations**

* âœ… **Avoids string conversion**: Uses number-based palindrome logic instead of string reversal.
* âœ… **Efficient palindrome generation**: Only generates numbers that are guaranteed to be base-10 palindromes.
* âœ… **BigInt**: Handles very large palindrome numbers safely (especially necessary when `k` is small and `n` is large).
* âœ… **Digit array reuse**: Reduces memory allocations by reusing a fixed-size array (`digit[]`) for base conversion.

---

### ðŸ§  Summary

This solution is optimal for constraints like `n â‰¤ 30`, where:

* Full iteration is too slow,
* But smart generation + validation gives fast results.

It balances between **mathematical construction** and **algorithmic filtering**, making it both fast and scalable.
