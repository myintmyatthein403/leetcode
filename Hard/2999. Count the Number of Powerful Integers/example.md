### ✅ **1. Digital Lock Code Validation (Security System)**

#### Scenario:
A company installs **digital locks** where valid codes must:
- Fall within a certain numeric range (e.g., between `1000` and `9999`)
- End with a specific code that changes daily (e.g., `"42"`)
- Use only digits less than or equal to a difficulty limit (e.g., `4`), for user-friendliness

#### Use Case:
```js
numberOfPowerfulInt(1000, 9999, 4, "42")
```

This would count **how many valid unlock codes** can be used today, ensuring they're easy enough to type (digits ≤ 4) and end in today's security suffix `"42"`.

### ✅ **2. Filter Customer Invoice Numbers**

#### Scenario:
A business tracks invoices where:
- Each invoice number is between a certain range (`start` to `finish`)
- Ends in a department-specific suffix (`s`, like `"24"` for Department 24)
- Uses digit constraints for legacy systems that can only process certain numbers (e.g., digits ≤ 6)

#### Use Case:
```js
numberOfPowerfulInt(100000, 999999, 6, "24")
```

This would give the **number of invoice IDs** belonging to Department 24 that comply with digit limits for processing in older systems.
