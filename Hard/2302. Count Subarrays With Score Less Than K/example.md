Let's explore **real-world applications** and **a web development example** where this "count subarrays with score less than k" logic is **practically useful**:

### 🎯 1st Real-World Example:  
**Video Streaming Platforms (Buffer Management)**

- Imagine Netflix is tracking the *data buffer size* during video streaming.
- **Each packet** has a size (say `nums` array = packet sizes), and they need to find how many contiguous chunks of packets can be played **without exceeding a certain network bandwidth** (`k`).
- Here, **sum = total data size**, and **length = how many packets**, so their *"score"* could represent **total load**.
- To optimize for network stability, they need to quickly calculate how many "playable chunks" exist that won't cause buffering issues.

### 🎯 2nd Real-World Example:  
**Finance (Risk Window Analysis)**

- A bank tracks **transaction amounts** over time.
- Each subarray represents **consecutive transactions**.
- They want to find out **how many time periods (subarrays)** have a "safe risk score" — where the risk score is the **sum of transactions × number of transactions** — and it must stay **below a regulatory limit** (`k`).
- This helps **flag risky patterns** early without scanning every possibility manually.

### 🌐 Web Development Example:  
**E-commerce (Cart Load Optimization)**

- On an e-commerce site, users add items to their cart (`nums` = item prices).
- To **recommend** combo offers, the platform could analyze **contiguous sequences of added items** whose **total value times number of items** (representing "deal complexity score") is **below a threshold** (`k`).
- This lets them **suggest bundles** dynamically — like "Add these 2-3 more items to get free shipping!"
- Fast sliding window calculation ensures **smooth UI experience** even if a user adds 20+ items.

✅ These examples show how the idea of **contiguous subarrays under a scoring threshold** is valuable across streaming, finance, and web optimization!
