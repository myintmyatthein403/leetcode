To solve this problem, we need to divide the `weights` array into `k` contiguous subarrays (bags) while considering the score calculation rules. Our goal is to find the difference between the maximum and minimum possible scores.

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Score Calculation**:  
   - Each bag's cost is calculated as `weights[i] + weights[j]`, where `i` and `j` are the indices marking the start and end of the bag.
   - The total score is the sum of all such bag costs.

2. **Contiguous Segments**:  
   - The marbles (weights) must be split into contiguous subarrays.
   - Every partition affects the possible sum of scores.

3. **Possible Approach**:
   - Instead of directly iterating through all possible partitions (which is computationally expensive), we can focus on the contribution of each possible partition.
   - The difference between the **maximal** and **minimal** scores is determined by selecting the most and least impactful partitions.

### **Efficient Approach Using Pair Differences:**
1. **Pair-wise Differences Matter**:  
   - The transition points in partitioning affect the score significantly.
   - Instead of considering the entire partitioning explicitly, focus on the "gaps" between adjacent elements.
   - The contribution of splitting at a certain index can be approximated by considering the sum of pairwise adjacent differences:  
     \[
     \text{gap}[i] = \text{weights}[i+1] - \text{weights}[i]
     \]
   - Larger gaps indicate better places to split.

2. **Sorting Gaps for Max/Min Scores**:
   - If we sort the array and consider the sum of the largest `k-1` gaps, it helps maximize the score.
   - Conversely, choosing the smallest `k-1` gaps minimizes the score.

3. **Final Steps**:
   - Compute the **maximum score** by choosing the largest `k-1` gaps.
   - Compute the **minimum score** by choosing the smallest `k-1` gaps.
   - The answer is the difference between these two scores.

### **Complexity Consideration**:
- Sorting the `weights` takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Constructing the gap array and summing the `k-1` largest and smallest values takes \(O(n)\).
- Overall, the approach runs in **\(O(n \log n)\)**, which is efficient for large inputs.

This method efficiently finds the optimal partitions without explicitly checking all possibilities, making it a practical solution.
