Let's break down the approach to solve this problem.

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem essentially asks us to simulate a traversal through a grid, counting the number of unique cells we can visit where the query value is strictly greater than the cell's value. We need to do this for each query.

**General Approach**

1.  **Iterate Through Queries:** We'll process each query in the `queries` array one by one.
2.  **Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS):** For each query, we'll use a graph traversal algorithm (BFS or DFS) to explore the grid.
3.  **Tracking Visited Cells:** We'll need to keep track of which cells we've visited to ensure we only count them once.
4.  **Condition for Movement:** We'll only move to an adjacent cell if the query value is strictly greater than the cell's value.
5.  **Counting Unique Cells:** We'll count the number of unique cells visited during the traversal.
6.  **Storing Results:** We'll store the count for each query in the `answer` array.

**Detailed Explanation**

1.  **Initialization:**
    * Create an `answer` array of the same size as `queries` to store the results.
    * For each query `queries[i]`, initialize a `visited` set (or a 2D boolean array) to track visited cells.
    * Initialize a `count` variable to 0.

2.  **Traversal (BFS or DFS):**
    * Start the traversal from the top-left cell (0, 0).
    * During the traversal:
        * Check if the current cell's value is less than `queries[i]`.
        * If it is, and the cell has not been visited:
            * Increment `count`.
            * Mark the cell as visited.
            * Explore all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
        * If the current cell's value is greater than or equal to `queries[i]` stop the current path.
3.  **Storing Results:**
    * After the traversal for `queries[i]` is complete, store the `count` in `answer[i]`.

4.  **Returning the Answer:**
    * Return the `answer` array.

**Key Considerations**

* **Efficiency:** For larger grids, BFS might be preferable to DFS to prevent potential stack overflow issues.
* **Visited Tracking:** Using a set or a boolean array to track visited cells is crucial to avoid revisiting cells and ensure correct counting.
* **Boundary Checks:** Remember to perform boundary checks to ensure that the traversal stays within the grid's bounds.
* **Multiple Visits:** The problem statement allows for multiple visits to the same cell, but only the first visit counts towards the score. The visited set or array will handle this.

**In essence, this is a graph traversal problem where the edges are determined by the query value and the cell values.**
