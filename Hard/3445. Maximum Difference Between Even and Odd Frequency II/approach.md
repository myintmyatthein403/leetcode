To solve the problem **‚ÄúMaximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency II‚Äù**, we need to find the **maximum value of `freq[a] - freq[b]`** for any substring of `s` of **length at least `k`**, such that:

* `freq[a]` is **odd** (frequency of character `a`)
* `freq[b]` is **even** (frequency of character `b`)

We return the **maximum difference** among all such valid substrings.

---

### üß† Key Observations:

1. The number of **distinct characters** is limited to 5 (digits '0' to '4'), so character frequency operations are cheap (O(1)).
2. A **brute-force approach** over all substrings of length ‚â• `k` is too slow (`O(n¬≤)`), since `n` can go up to `30,000`.
3. So, we need a more efficient approach that avoids recalculating frequencies from scratch for every substring.

---

### ‚úÖ Approach:

#### Step 1: Sliding Window

* Use a **sliding window** to explore substrings of size `k` or greater.
* Start with a window of size `k`, and **expand** the window to the right.
* For each window, maintain a **frequency map** of digits `'0'` to `'4'`.

#### Step 2: Track Frequencies

* For the current window, count the **frequencies of all characters** in the substring.
* Identify:

  * The **maximum odd frequency** `freq[a]`
  * The **minimum even frequency** `freq[b]`

#### Step 3: Compute Difference

* For every valid window:

  * Loop through each digit `'0'` to `'4'`:

    * If frequency is odd ‚Üí consider as candidate for `a`
    * If frequency is even and non-zero ‚Üí consider as candidate for `b`
  * Calculate all possible `freq[a] - freq[b]` combinations.
  * Keep track of the **maximum** difference found across all windows.

#### Step 4: Edge Handling

* If no valid `a` (odd freq) or `b` (even freq) exists in a window ‚Üí skip it.
* If no valid combinations found for any window ‚Üí return `-1`.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n * c¬≤)`

  * `n` = length of string (up to 30,000)
  * `c` = constant number of characters (max 5 digits ‚Üí constant)
* **Space Complexity**: `O(c)` for the frequency map.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases

* All substrings have only odd or only even frequencies ‚Üí return `-1`.
* Frequencies can change as the window slides ‚Üí must update efficiently.
* Since `k` is at least 3 and at most `n`, we always have substrings to process.

This solution is a highly optimized version of solving the **"Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency II"** problem. Instead of naively checking all substrings (which is too slow for long strings), it uses **prefix difference optimization**, **bitmasking**, and **parity tracking**.

Let‚Äôs break it down step-by-step.

---

## üîç **High-Level Idea**

We're trying to find the **maximum** value of:

```
freq[a] - freq[b]
```

‚Ä¶in any substring `subs` of length ‚â• `k`, such that:

* `freq[a]` is **odd**
* `freq[b]` is **even**

We solve this by:

* Iterating over **all pairs** `(a, b)` where `a ‚â† b`.
* Keeping a **prefix difference (freq\[a] - freq\[b])**.
* Tracking frequency **parity (even or odd)** using **bitmasking**.
* Using a **sliding window** with precomputed best values based on parity.

## üî£ **Function: `getStatus(cnt_a, cnt_b)`**

This returns a 2-bit number:

```js
((cnt_a & 1) << 1) | (cnt_b & 1)
```

This gives 4 possible combinations:

| cnt\_a parity | cnt\_b parity | status (binary) | decimal |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------- |
| even          | even          | `00`            | 0       |
| even          | odd           | `01`            | 1       |
| odd           | even          | `10`            | 2 ‚úÖ     |
| odd           | odd           | `11`            | 3       |

We‚Äôre interested in `status == 2` (odd `a`, even `b`).

---

## üß† **Explanation of the Main Logic**

### 1. **Iterate over all `(a, b)` pairs**

We test all combinations of characters from `'0'` to `'5'` (though input only uses `'0'`‚Äì`'4'`, it includes `'5'` for generality or safety).

### 2. **Initialize:**

* `best[4]` stores the **minimum value of `prefix_diff = freq[a] - freq[b]`** seen so far **for each parity combination**.
* `cnt_a`, `cnt_b`: current running counts of `a` and `b`
* `prev_a`, `prev_b`: counts at the left end of the window
* `left`: sliding window's left boundary

### 3. **Main Sliding Window Loop**

For every character in the string:

* Update count of `a` and `b`
* Maintain a sliding window of size at least `k`
* When window is large enough (`right - left >= k`) and `cnt_b - prev_b >= 2`, we do:

  * Store the best prefix difference `prev_a - prev_b` for the current parity of `(prev_a, prev_b)`
  * Move `left` to the right and update `prev_a`, `prev_b`

### 4. **Query Using Bitmasking**

* Get the `right_status = getStatus(cnt_a, cnt_b)`
* We are looking for **left prefix status** that differs from the right by toggling the **a-parity bit** (`^ 0b10`)

  * This gives a valid pairing of `(odd a, even b)`
* If such a value was stored in `best`, we compute:

  ```js
  ans = max(ans, (cnt_a - cnt_b) - best[relevant_status])
  ```

## ‚úÖ **Key Optimizations**

| Optimization                | Explanation                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Character pair pruning**  | Only test all pairs (a, b), not all substrings.                                     |
| **Prefix difference**       | Uses cumulative frequency differences rather than recalculating substrings.         |
| **Bitmask parity tracking** | Efficiently tracks odd/even status using a 2-bit key.                               |
| **Best prefix storage**     | Stores minimum prefix difference per parity state to allow fast difference lookups. |
| **Sliding window**          | Maintains window size ‚â• `k` without redundant checks.                               |

## üß™ Example Test

```js
maxDifference("330130303114333", 13);
// Expected Output: -3
```

This solution efficiently handles large strings (up to 30,000 characters) in `O(N * 25)` time, where `25` comes from all pairs of digits.

---

## üß† Summary

* **Goal**: Maximize `freq[a] - freq[b]` under constraints.
* **Techniques**: Prefix diff, parity bitmask, character-pair scanning.
* **Performance**: Much faster than brute force (runs in near-linear time).
* **Elegance**: Clever use of bitwise logic to enforce parity constraints.
