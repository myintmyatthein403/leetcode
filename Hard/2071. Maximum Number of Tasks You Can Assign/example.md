Sure! Here are **2 real-world examples** and **1 web development example** where a task assignment problem with limited boosts (like "pills") is applicable:

---

### 🔧 Real-World Example 1: **Warehouse Order Fulfillment**
**Context:**  
A warehouse has a number of employees (`workers`), and they need to fulfill orders (`tasks`) that require different physical strength levels (lifting, moving, etc.).  

**Real-life “pill”:**  
There are a few forklifts or lifting tools available (`pills`) that increase a worker’s capacity (`strength`). Each worker can only use one tool at a time.

**Use:**  
Determine the maximum number of orders that can be fulfilled in a day by optimally assigning workers and tools.

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Example 2: **Construction Project Scheduling**
**Context:**  
You have several construction tasks that require various skill levels (e.g., masonry, welding, etc.), and a pool of workers with varying expertise.

**Real-life “pill”:**  
You can assign temporary consultants or provide quick training sessions to a few workers to boost their capability (`strength` boost).

**Use:**  
Maximize the number of construction tasks completed by deciding who should receive the extra support/training.

### 🌐 Web Development Example: **Task Queues with Limited Server Resources**
**Context:**  
A server system is processing background jobs (e.g., image processing, data transformations). Each job requires a certain CPU/memory load (`tasks[i]`). Each server (`workers[j]`) has limited capacity.

**"Pills":**  
You can temporarily burst resource usage (e.g., use a performance boost, spin up a micro VM, or assign higher priority in a queue). Limited by cost, so only a few (`pills`) can be applied.

**Use:**  
Optimize how many tasks your system can handle in parallel by choosing when and to whom to apply these temporary resource boosts.
