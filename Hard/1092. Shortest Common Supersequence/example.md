### **Real-World Examples of Using Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS)**  

#### **1. Merging Version-Controlled Files (Git Merge)**
   - In software development, when multiple developers work on different versions of the same file, **SCS** can help in merging changes.  
   - Given two versions of a file (`str1` and `str2`), the **SCS** ensures that the merged result retains all edits while minimizing duplication.  
   - **Example:**  
     - Developer A's code: `"function fetchData() { getData(); }"`  
     - Developer B's code: `"function fetchData() { loadData(); }"`  
     - Merged version (SCS result): `"function fetchData() { getData(); loadData(); }"`

#### **2. DNA Sequence Alignment in Bioinformatics**
   - In genetics, researchers often compare DNA sequences of different species or individuals to find common patterns while keeping the full genetic information intact.  
   - The **SCS** helps in aligning DNA sequences while preserving both original sequences as subsequences.  
   - **Example:**  
     - DNA Sequence 1: `"AGGTAB"`  
     - DNA Sequence 2: `"GXTXAYB"`  
     - **Shortest Common Supersequence:** `"AGGXTXAYB"`  
   - This helps scientists understand evolutionary relationships and mutations.

These are just two examples, but **SCS** is widely used in **text processing, speech recognition, and data compression** as well! ðŸš€
