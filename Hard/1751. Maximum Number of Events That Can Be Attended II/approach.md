To solve **Leetcode 1751 - Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II**, the problem requires maximizing the sum of values from **up to `k` non-overlapping events**. Here’s the **high-level approach and reasoning** without code:

---

### 🔍 **1. Sort Events by End Time**

* Since we want to avoid overlapping events, sorting by `endDay` allows us to use **binary search** efficiently to find the latest non-overlapping event.
* This also makes dynamic programming tractable, as the decisions depend on previous events ending before the current starts.

---

### 💡 **2. Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**

We define a DP state:

* **`dp[i][j]`** = the **maximum value** by attending **at most `j` events** from the **first `i` events**.

#### Key transitions:

For each event:

* **Option 1: Skip the current event** → take the result from the previous event.
* **Option 2: Attend the current event**:

  * Use **binary search** to find the **last non-overlapping event**.
  * Add the value of the current event to the best value from the previous compatible event with one fewer choice (i.e., `j-1`).

---

### 🧠 **3. Binary Search for Non-Overlapping Events**

* To attend an event, we need to find the most recent event (before the current one) whose `endDay < startDay` of the current event.
* This can be done efficiently using binary search because we sorted events by `endDay`.

---

### ⚙️ **4. Space Optimization (Optional)**

* Since we only need previous states, you can optimize from a 2D DP array to a rolling 1D array to reduce memory usage.

---

### 🧮 **Final Answer**

* After processing all events with up to `k` selections, the answer is the maximum value in the last layer of the DP array.

---

### 🧠 Conceptual Summary:

This is a **classic interval scheduling** problem with a twist: a **limit on number of events** (`k`). It combines:

* **Greedy sorting** (by end time),
* **Binary search** (to find compatible events),
* **Dynamic programming** (to track optimal solutions over time and count).

Time complexity is about **O(n log n \* k)**, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.
