To solve this problem efficiently, we need to understand the two constraints:

1. Each number in the array must be between `1` and `maxValue`.
2. Each number (except the first) must be divisible by the number before it.

### Core Idea:

We want to **count all distinct arrays of length `n`** that satisfy the above properties. This is a **combinatorics + number theory + dynamic programming** type of problem.

---

### Step-by-Step Approach:

#### 1. **Observation - Tree Structure of Divisibility**
Each ideal array can be seen as a **path in a tree**, where:
- The root can be any number from `1` to `maxValue`.
- From each node, you can go to its **multiples** (i.e., if the current number is `x`, next number can be `x`, `2x`, `3x`, ... as long as `<= maxValue`).

So, from a given starting number, all sequences of length `n` where each element is a multiple of the previous one represent valid ideal arrays.

---

#### 2. **Break the Problem into Two Parts**

- **Part A: Count how many such divisible chains exist of each length `k` (≤ n)** starting from each number `v` (`1 <= v <= maxValue`).
- **Part B: For each such chain length `k`, calculate how many ways to place this chain of `k` values in an array of length `n`**. That’s a combinatorics problem — choosing positions for increases.

---

#### 3. **Dynamic Programming (Part A): Count Sequences of Length k Starting with v**
Use dynamic programming to **precompute** the number of increasing sequences of length `k` that start with a value `v`, where each subsequent value is a multiple of the previous one.

You can:
- Iterate over length `k` from 1 to a maximum (bounded by log(maxValue)).
- For each number `v`, you build up the number of valid sequences of length `k` ending at `v` using its divisors.

This structure ensures we don't recompute paths and can scale.

---

#### 4. **Combinatorics (Part B): Choose Position of Elements in Array**
Once you have a sequence of `k` values, you want to stretch it to a length-`n` array by inserting duplicates.

This is done by:
- Choosing `k - 1` positions in the array to place the transitions (i.e., when the next number comes in).
- The number of such placements in array of length `n` is:  
  **C(n - 1, k - 1)**

Use **binomial coefficients** (`n choose k`) to calculate this efficiently. Precompute factorials and inverses up to `n`.

---

#### 5. **Final Count**
For each valid sequence of length `k` starting at some value `v`, multiply:
- The number of such sequences
- The number of ways to distribute it into array of length `n`

Sum this over all `k` and all `v`.

---

### Optimization Notes:

- The length `k` can go up to `log2(maxValue)` at most, since with each multiplication you grow rapidly.
- Use memoization to avoid recomputing values.
- Use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) throughout to keep numbers within bounds.

---

### Summary:
We reduce the problem to:
- Counting sequences where every next value is a multiple of the previous.
- Distributing those sequences into a longer array using combinatorics.
- Combining both counts efficiently using dynamic programming and precomputed combinatorial values.
