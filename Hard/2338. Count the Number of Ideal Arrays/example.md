Let‚Äôs explore **real-world and web development** applications of this kind of **"ideal array" generation** ‚Äî i.e., constrained sequence generation with multiplicative/divisibility rules.

### üîπ **Real World Example 1: Supply Chain Optimization**

**Scenario:**  
In a manufacturing pipeline, parts must be assembled in a strict sequence where each part must be compatible with the previous one. Compatibility is defined by constraints like size or slot-fittings ‚Äî where the size of one component must be a multiple of the previous one.

**Use Case:**  
Generate and count all valid component sequences (of fixed length `n`) from a catalog (`maxValue`) where each part must fit properly onto the previous one (i.e., divisible).  
This helps manufacturers evaluate how many different configurations of a product are possible.

### üîπ **Real World Example 2: Hierarchical File System Access**

**Scenario:**  
In a secured multi-user system, access levels are structured in a hierarchy. A user's access to a directory (level `i`) depends on them having access to its parent (level `i-1`), and access is only granted if the current level‚Äôs security tag is divisible by the previous.

**Use Case:**  
Count how many permission chains are possible, given a number of levels `n` and a maximum permission value. Helps in designing scalable and auditable permission models in large enterprise systems.

### üåê **Web Development Example: Modular CMS Plugin Compatibility**

**Scenario:**  
You're building a **CMS platform** with a **plugin system**, where:
- Plugins can extend each other in chains.
- A plugin is compatible with another only if it is an **extension (multiple)** of the previous one (e.g., Plugin 2x must depend on Plugin x).

**Use Case:**  
To show users how many different plugin stacks (of size `n`) can be created given `maxValue` plugins, ensuring compatibility. You might display all valid plugin chains or compute the total count for recommendation systems or analytics dashboards.
