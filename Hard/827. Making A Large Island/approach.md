Let's break down the approach to solve the problem "Making A Large Island" step by step in JavaScript.

### Problem Summary:
You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`. You are allowed to change **at most one** `0` to `1`. Return the size of the largest **island** in `grid` after applying this operation. An **island** is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify and Label Islands**:
   - Traverse the grid to identify all islands and label them with unique identifiers.
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore each island and calculate its size.
   - Store the size of each island in a map with the island identifier as the key.

2. **Calculate Initial Maximum Island Size**:
   - Track the maximum size of any island found during the initial traversal.

3. **Evaluate Changing Each `0` to `1`**:
   - For each cell in the grid that is `0`, evaluate the potential size of the island if this cell is changed to `1`.
   - Check the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) to see which islands would be connected by this change.
   - Sum the sizes of these connected islands and add `1` for the changed cell itself.
   - Track the maximum island size possible after changing one `0` to `1`.

4. **Return the Maximum Island Size**:
   - Return the maximum island size found either from the initial islands or after changing one `0` to `1`.

### JavaScript Implementation:

Here is the JavaScript implementation of the above approach:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestIsland = function(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    const islandSizeMap = new Map();
    let islandId = 2; // Start from 2 to avoid confusion with 0 and 1
    let maxIslandSize = 0;

    // Function to perform DFS and label the island
    function dfs(x, y, id) {
        if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= n || y >= n || grid[x][y] !== 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        grid[x][y] = id;
        let size = 1;
        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            size += dfs(x + dx, y + dy, id);
        }
        return size;
    }

    // Step 1: Identify and label islands
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                const size = dfs(i, j, islandId);
                islandSizeMap.set(islandId, size);
                maxIslandSize = Math.max(maxIslandSize, size);
                islandId++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Evaluate changing each `0` to `1`
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 0) {
                const seenIslands = new Set();
                let potentialSize = 1; // Changing this `0` to `1`
                for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                    const x = i + dx;
                    const y = j + dy;
                    if (x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < n && y < n && grid[x][y] > 1) {
                        const id = grid[x][y];
                        if (!seenIslands.has(id)) {
                            seenIslands.add(id);
                            potentialSize += islandSizeMap.get(id);
                        }
                    }
                }
                maxIslandSize = Math.max(maxIslandSize, potentialSize);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxIslandSize;
};

// Example usage:
const grid1 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]];
console.log(largestIsland(grid1)); // Output: 3

const grid2 = [[1, 1], [1, 0]];
console.log(largestIsland(grid2)); // Output: 4

const grid3 = [[1, 1], [1, 1]];
console.log(largestIsland(grid3)); // Output: 4
```

### Explanation:
1. **Identify and Label Islands**:
   - We use DFS to traverse the grid and label each island with a unique identifier starting from `2`.
   - We store the size of each island in a map (`islandSizeMap`).

2. **Calculate Initial Maximum Island Size**:
   - As we label the islands, we keep track of the maximum island size found.

3. **Evaluate Changing Each `0` to `1`**:
   - For each `0` in the grid, we check its neighboring cells to see which islands would be connected if this `0` is changed to `1`.
   - We sum the sizes of these connected islands and add `1` for the changed cell itself.
   - We update the maximum island size if this potential size is larger.

4. **Return the Maximum Island Size**:
   - Finally, we return the maximum island size found either from the initial islands or after changing one `0` to `1`.

This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the size of the largest island possible after changing at most one `0` to `1`.
