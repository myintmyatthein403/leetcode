Here are two real-world examples where the approach to solving the "Making A Large Island" problem can be applied:

### Example 1: Urban Planning and Infrastructure Development
In urban planning, cities are often represented as grids where each cell can be a building, park, road, or empty land. Planners need to maximize the connectivity of green spaces (parks) to create larger, contiguous green areas for better urban living.

**Problem**: Given a city grid where `1` represents a park and `0` represents other types of land, determine the maximum size of a contiguous park area that can be achieved by converting at most one non-park cell (`0`) into a park (`1`).

**Usage**:
- **Green Space Optimization**: By identifying the optimal cell to convert, urban planners can maximize green space connectivity, improving environmental quality and providing larger recreational areas for residents.
- **Resource Allocation**: This approach helps in making informed decisions about where to allocate resources for park development to achieve the greatest impact on urban green space.

### Example 2: Network Reliability and Redundancy
In network design, nodes represent servers or routers, and edges represent connections between them. Ensuring high reliability and redundancy in the network is crucial for preventing failures.

**Problem**: Given a network grid where `1` represents an active connection and `0` represents a potential connection, determine the maximum size of a connected network segment that can be achieved by activating at most one potential connection (`0` to `1`).

**Usage**:
- **Network Optimization**: By identifying the optimal connection to activate, network engineers can maximize the redundancy and reliability of the network, ensuring that the network remains operational even if some connections fail.
- **Failure Prevention**: This approach helps in identifying critical points in the network where adding a connection can significantly enhance the overall connectivity and robustness of the network.

These examples illustrate how the approach to solving the "Making A Large Island" problem can be applied to practical scenarios in urban planning and network design, leading to more efficient and effective solutions.
