Here are **2 real-world examples in software development** and **1 in web development** where the logic behind the **Candy problem** (i.e., greedy, two-pass allocation based on comparative values) is practically useful:

---

### üß† **Software Development Example 1: Employee Bonus Allocation**

**Scenario:**
In a company, employees are rated annually based on performance. To fairly distribute bonuses:

* Each employee must get at least a base bonus.
* Employees with higher ratings than their immediate peers must get a higher bonus.

**Application:**
Use the **candy problem algorithm** to compute the **minimum bonus distribution** that satisfies both fairness and performance-based reward conditions.

### üß† **Software Development Example 2: Game Level XP Distribution**

**Scenario:**
In a game, players progress through levels with difficulty ratings. To balance progression rewards:

* Every level must give at least some XP.
* A harder level than the previous should give more XP to reflect difficulty.
* Conversely, if a level is easier than the next, XP should be adjusted accordingly.

**Application:**
Use the two-pass approach to determine **minimum XP points per level** such that the XP distribution reflects the level difficulty fairly.

### üåê **Web Development Example: Rating-Based Badge System**

**Scenario:**
On a web platform like a learning site (e.g., Codecademy or LeetCode), users receive **badges** based on the difficulty of courses they've completed:

* Every user gets at least one badge.
* If a user completes a harder course than a neighboring user (in terms of difficulty or completion streak), they should get a better badge.

**Application:**
When rendering badges on a profile page or leaderboard, use a **greedy approach** like the Candy problem to assign badge levels. This ensures a fair and consistent visual representation based on user achievements.

These examples show that **comparative resource allocation** problems are common in systems that require **fairness, progression, and efficiency** ‚Äî all of which align with the principles behind the Candy problem.
