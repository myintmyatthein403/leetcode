To solve this problem, the goal is to determine **in which round the two strongest players can face each other ‚Äî as early as possible and as late as possible**. The players always face the mirror-positioned opponent in the row, and the winners return based on their original indices. The two given players **always win** until they meet, while outcomes of matches between other players can be controlled to influence the timing of this match.

### ‚úÖ Problem Breakdown:

* Players are matched from **both ends toward the center**: 1st with nth, 2nd with (n-1)th, etc.
* The order of winners in each round is sorted by their original index positions (e.g., ascending by player number).
* If there's an odd number of players, the middle player advances automatically.
* The only fixed condition is: `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` **must** win all matches until they face each other.

So, we need to explore all **valid tournament progressions** that obey this rule and record the **earliest** and **latest** rounds in which `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` meet.

### üß† Approach (No Code):

#### Step 1: **Normalize Positions**

* Convert `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` into **indices in the current round**.
* Every round, players are rematched based on current list of participants, but after matches, we reorder the winners based on their original positions.

#### Step 2: **Simulate Tournament**

* Use **recursive backtracking** or **memoized DFS** to simulate all valid ways the tournament can progress.
* At each round:

  * If `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are paired (i.e., at opposite ends), record the current round number.
  * Otherwise:

    * For every match between two non-strong players, try **both outcomes**.
    * Always assume `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` win their matches (if they have one).
    * Build a list of winners and proceed to the next round.

#### Step 3: **Track Round Numbers**

* Keep track of the minimum round when `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` meet (for **earliest**).
* Also track the maximum round when they can possibly meet (for **latest**).

### üîç Key Observations:

* Since `n` ‚â§ 28, the total number of recursive paths is manageable if pruned intelligently using memoization.
* The match between `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` can be delayed by having them on **opposite ends** of the sorted winner list for as many rounds as possible.
* It can happen immediately (in Round 1) if they are already placed to face each other from the start.

---

### üß© Summary:

This is essentially a **state-space search** problem where you:

* Fix `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` as always winning.
* Simulate all valid ways the other players could win or lose.
* Find the minimum and maximum round where the strong players meet.

‚û°Ô∏è Use **DFS with memoization** to avoid recomputation and return `[earliest, latest]`.
