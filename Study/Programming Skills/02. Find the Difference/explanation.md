### Real World Example of Usage for `findTheDifference`

The `findTheDifference` function can be applied in various real-world scenarios where you need to identify an extra element in one list compared to another. Here are two examples:

#### Example 1: Inventory Management

**Scenario**:
You are managing the inventory of a warehouse. At the beginning of the day, you have a list of items in stock (`s`). At the end of the day, you have a new list of items in stock (`t`), which includes all the items from the beginning of the day plus any new items that were added during the day. You need to identify the new item that was added to the inventory.

**Input**:
- `s`: A string representing the initial inventory items.
- `t`: A string representing the end-of-day inventory items.

**Example**:
```javascript
const initialInventory = "abcd";
const endOfDayInventory = "abcde";
console.log(findTheDifference(initialInventory, endOfDayInventory)); // Output: "e"
```

**Explanation**:
- The function identifies that the item `e` was added to the inventory during the day.

#### Example 2: Data Integrity Check

**Scenario**:
You are working on a data synchronization system where you need to ensure that two datasets are identical. You have a dataset `s` that represents the original data, and a dataset `t` that represents the data after synchronization. You need to identify if there is any extra data in the synchronized dataset `t` that was not present in the original dataset `s`.

**Input**:
- `s`: A string representing the original dataset.
- `t`: A string representing the synchronized dataset.

**Example**:
```javascript
const originalData = "xyz";
const synchronizedData = "xyza";
console.log(findTheDifference(originalData, synchronizedData)); // Output: "a"
```

**Explanation**:
- The function identifies that the extra data `a` was added during the synchronization process.

### Visualization of the Code

Let's visualize the process with the example of inventory management:

- **Initial Inventory (`s`)**: `"abcd"`
  - `sMap`: `{a: 1, b: 1, c: 1, d: 1}`

- **End of Day Inventory (`t`)**: `"abcde"`
  - `tMap`: `{a: 1, b: 1, c: 1, d: 1, e: 1}`

- **Comparison**:
  - Compare `sMap` and `tMap`:
    - `a`: `1 == 1`
    - `b`: `1 == 1`
    - `c`: `1 == 1`
    - `d`: `1 == 1`
    - `e`: `undefined != 1` (extra character found)

The function correctly identifies `e` as the extra character added to the inventory.

### Example Usage in a Real World Scenario
```javascript
console.log(findTheDifference("abcd", "abcde")); // Output: "e"
console.log(findTheDifference("", "y")); // Output: "y"
console.log(findTheDifference("a", "aa")); // Output: "a"
```
- These examples find the extra character in the end-of-day inventory list compared to the initial inventory list, identify an extra data element added during synchronization, and detect an additional character in a simple string comparison.
