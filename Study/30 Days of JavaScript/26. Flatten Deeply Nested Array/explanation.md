### Example 1: Flattening a Nested Array of Comments
Suppose you have a nested array of comments where each comment can have replies, and you want to flatten the array to a certain depth to display a simplified view.

```javascript
const comments = [
  "Comment 1",
  ["Reply 1.1", "Reply 1.2", ["Reply 1.2.1"]],
  "Comment 2",
  ["Reply 2.1"]
];

const flattenedComments = flat(comments, 1);
console.log(flattenedComments);
// Output: ["Comment 1", "Reply 1.1", "Reply 1.2", ["Reply 1.2.1"], "Comment 2", "Reply 2.1"]
```

### Example 2: Flattening a Nested Array of Categories
Imagine you have a nested array of product categories and subcategories, and you want to flatten it to a certain depth for easier processing.

```javascript
const categories = [
  "Electronics",
  ["Phones", ["Smartphones", "Feature Phones"]],
  "Home Appliances",
  ["Kitchen", ["Microwave", "Refrigerator"]]
];

const flattenedCategories = flat(categories, 2);
console.log(flattenedCategories);
// Output: ["Electronics", "Phones", "Smartphones", "Feature Phones", "Home Appliances", "Kitchen", "Microwave", "Refrigerator"]
```

These examples demonstrate how the `flat` function can be used to simplify nested arrays in real-world scenarios.
